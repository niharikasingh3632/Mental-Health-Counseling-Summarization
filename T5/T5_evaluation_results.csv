0,"Summarize: You okay now kind of taking a look at some of your thinking and situation from that point of view, okay. Some things kind of stand out for me and hearing you talk about what's been happening and your feelings I can appreciate. It's really painful. And I would say to the reader that you can step back and try to look at the thoughts. I think that you'll see it's it's helpful although I know It's a little difficult or unusual to separate feelings from thoughts sometimes. But I'd like to try to kind of distinguish between the two. Okay. You said that you've been at your job for about five years. You really like your job. So tell me about your job, like kind of how you felt about it, but frame it in a time before this ever happened. I like my job because I felt like I was helping people. So it was meaningful. And, you know, when I went there, Time went by fast. So it was kind of like, I was enjoying myself, you know, not super fast. I wasn't having the best time of my life, but it was something where I would go and you know, I felt like I was doing something important and the day didn't drag on and, you know, I got along with my co workers and that kind of thing. So it felt meaningful to me. meaningful. So you remember accomplishing things at that job that you felt benefits society, the people you help. Yeah, I feel like, you know, doing my job, I got to know people, you know, help people out with things that they needed. You know, when things were bad I could, you know, get kids out of situations that were really dangerous for them and, you know, no one else was going to do that for them. So I felt like I was the kind of person that was making keeping people safe. I guess. You kept people safe. And you had a lot of satisfaction from the work you did. And now doesn't feel that way?  Now, not at all.  When you described it, it almost sounds like you talked about how you're afraid of making a mistake. You're thinking about yourself in a way where you're almost risk. Yeah, I was just about to say it feels dangerous. To be there like to do my job, it feels dangerous. Your your work right now even though you have this one, situations extremely stressful and hard on you. You have other families that you interact with now to you tell me about those interactions. I mean, I guess it's like, quantitatively the same as before. I do the same things with families. But now I kind of feel like I can't trust my own judgment like everything. Before everything just kind of felt a little more black and white, and now it just feels like everything is so much a shade of gray that I just can't tell. You know what's right and what's wrong anymore. And every time I feel like I have a good instinct I doubt it I question it I have all these ideas of, well, you know, if I remove the kids from this family, what if they're not really doing the things? I think they're doing? Like what if the parents are actually good parents? What if the kids get put into a home that's bad for them? So this is maybe what's different. This what you're saying from before till now? Is decisions seemed clear cut. Yeah, sometimes it was tougher than others, but it just seemed more like I could make a decision and kind of wipe my hands of it and, you know, move on to the next thing. And now I just feel like there's all these doubts in my head and all these questions about if I'm doing the right thing. All right. So you're looking inward, you're looking at yourself a lot of self doubt. Now you're looking at decisions as much more difficult. It's much more difficult to come to the right decision. And second guessing sounds like move to second guessing a bit. When you do make a decision, like playing over over your mind. What could go wrong here? Is that the thought you're having? Yeah, yeah, definitely. I feel like I'm second guessing everything.","The patient loves their job and has been very helpful by saving kids from dangerous sitations. But it doesn't feel like that anymore. The patient is afraid recently of making a mistake in their job. The patient does the same as before, but now they are not able to trust their own judgement. They are having self doubts and second guessing everything.",you said that you've been at your job for about five years . you said that you like your job because you felt like you were helping people . you said that you're afraid of making a mistake and you're thinking about yourself in a way where you're almost risk .,0.04642161555273055,0.18352484703063965
1,"Summarize: Are you doing today? Good. How you doing? I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. I understand you had some symptoms recently they've been bothering you. Yeah. Could you tell me about those? Yeah, probably for the last eight months, maybe a year even, you know, I have this position at work where I have to make these weekly presentations and, and it's killing me. I can't do it anymore. Tell me about how these presentations are set up. So it's a it's, it's the executive director and it's 10 managers, we're kind of sitting in a circle and everybody goes around and does like a weekly program update. Five minutes or so maybe 10. At the most if there's an issue that kind of needs to be adjusted. And but everybody takes turns speaking and it goes around kind of around in a circle. And you know, depending on where you said is what order you present and basically and you say that this situation the presentation you said it's killing you. Yeah,  would feeling so you have I feel like it's constantly on my mind and constantly worried about this presentation. And even though I only have to speak for like five minutes, I'm so consumed by by this part of my job that I can't I can't do anything else and I normally feel like I do good in my job but but this and, you know, it just, it builds up more like every day the day before is is really bad because I'm prepping for the meeting. And so it really starts to consume me then I don't sleep the night before. And then by the time you know, I get to the meeting I'm, I'm so anxious and so nervous, I'm panicking and everything, and I just can't. I just can't. So, so this is this is distressing for you. And this is probably difficult to, to talk about the beginning of the meeting what would be your anxiety level what's going on then? By the beginning of the meeting, when I've sat down, I'm, I'm, I feel like I'm breathing harder. I'm starting to sweat. And I feel like my face is turning red. My palms are really sweaty and costly having to wipe them off on my pants. I My heart is racing. And I feel like you know, the closer it gets to being my turn, I feel like everything just gets worse. I feel like I'm breathing harder and my heart is beating faster and louder. I feel like everybody can hear it. My stomach just gets in knots, I feel nauseous. And I can't, you know, there have been times that I've managed to like just hold my hand still, and just sit really still. And I've tried some deep breathing and just satin and have made it through. And I have have made it to my, my presentation and and been able to speak but even then when I speak, I stutter and I stammer over my words, and I don't say everything I need to even I have a cheat sheet essentially. And I can reframe it. I still feel like I'm missing things and I'm leaving things out and my voice doesn't project so I end up speaking very softly and like I said, I'm stuttering, I just can't get it. Even then, it's it's still I feel like it's still a mess. You're not you're not happy with the quality of your prison. Now even even when you're able to kind of stay there and conducted, so I want to divide this into the stages. So we talked about the very beginning. So you're already having anxieties sounds like it's fairly intense at that point. Tell me about as they go around the table and give their brief presentations. Tell me about what you're feeling as, as the presentations come around to you. Well, if I if I manage somehow to get there early enough, and I can get an early enough seat like to sit like right next to my boss, or like, like one or two away, then I'm actually pretty okay. Because I can, I can kind of get it over and done. But so many times I'm so nervous and honestly, a bit hungover because I've been drinking too to try and I don't feel anxious want to drink. So there have been a lot of times that I've I've woken up a little bit late because I've been drinking. And so by the time I get there, like one of the last, it's one of the last seats, so I'm one of the last to go. And so as it gets closer and closer to me, I just feel more and more anxious and panicky. And here in, especially in the last few weeks, I've had to leave, I can say, I've got to go. So before before the presentations come around to you, you get up and yeah, leave the room. So in those times when you've stayed in the room and you've done the presentation, so the anxiety, the anxiety, the panic, the heart rate, sweaty palms, all these symptoms are increasing as they go around the table or the room and when it comes to you actually giving your presentation. You're not happy with that but what strings it level like during your presentation. I feel like during the presentation, I feel almost like everything. So everything stops. And then and then when it's done, and it goes to whoever's next. It's like, it's almost like a physical sense of relief. Like, okay, that's over and everything starts to relax and calm down, but then I feel miserable. I am so, so upset with how I performed that, that more than anybody else that that might that will really that everybody is like, What is wrong with her, but that my boss especially is like, why did I give her this job again, and I feel so so miserable, that that I've I feel like I've disappointed him and I've so I've disappointed me. And I mean, this has always, always happened to me. For as long as I can remember, I've never been able to speak in front of groups and you know, from back in college. If I had to make a presentation, I would ask the teacher if there's a way out of it. And if they refuse, then I wouldn't present. And I had a teacher who insisted that I make the presentation, and I dropped the class and I took it again, with a different teacher that wouldn't make me present because I couldn't do it. And High School is the same that I would, you know, I just wouldn't do it. And actually, this is ridiculous. You know, I mentioned drinking. I've been drinking for a really long time. When I was like, I don't know like, 13 or 14, I got busted for underage drinking and I had to do some, like adolescent treatment and I had to do this like group therapy with these other kids and I couldn't do that i bolted out of the room and so never been able to do this ever. See if you've had these symptoms for a long time, they've been frustrating you for a long time have a period of time where you haven't had to be in front of other people. Um, well if I haven't had to be in front of other people I've been I've been kind of okay you know, I can go to the movies but I like to sit on yet and you know, I can go out with with my family and my friends and we can go shopping but I don't like to go to new places. I like to go kind of like the same places that have familiar Yeah, yeah. Cuz because I know them. You know, I know The layout of stores and things like that. So it interferes with your functioning. Maybe a little bit. But if you're not having to present, it's not as big a deal as it is now for you. Yes job.  Yes,  it's really affecting it. So are you taking any measures? Or have you take any measures other than drinking, you mentioned, to avoid a situation to avoid? Oh, definitely. I mean, there's like I said, I mean, I've run out of the meetings. There's been times that I've called in sick when I haven't been there's been times when I've, I've said I've had car trouble arrived so late that it was unreasonable to make my presentation. I've actually talked to my boss about possibly not doing the presentation and just giving my notes to him or to brief him before after and because I have to say that I have this problem. I mean, Normal people don't do this, right? I mean, normal people can make these presents, like the rest of the staff can do it, why can't I? And so I don't want to tell him that, you know, I that there's something wrong with me. I mean, it's, it's gotten to the point that I've talked to him about, you know, this other position that's in another department and transferring so that I wouldn't have to do this anymore. And and it would it would be a pay cut. I mean, it's a demotion but I can't live like this.  This is too painful. If you had the other job, his other job would involve presentations. So you'd be happier. You'd have fewer symptoms in that job. What's been the result of that discussion? Has there been anything has happened as far as well. He has told me that he thinks something In a good job excuse me, and he doesn't want me to. Here's what I'm going to change positions. But I can't, I can't do this anymore. All right, so you've you've tried, you try to cope with anxiety. You've had to leave colon, colon sick or come in late. You've looked for different position or doesn't involve presenting. You've had this problem in other circumstances, the group therapy and in presentations before Do you or have you seen any symptoms like this and your parents? Yeah, both of my parents and my sister actually. We were kind of joke about it. Some times that we all get so nervous. And my sister, I don't know how but she managed to find a job where she doesn't interact with anybody. It's her in her office with our computer by herself. And it's just, it's just hurt. I don't know how she pulled it off. I mean, she doesn't. She hardly talks on the phone. And she's really happy and my parents they actually they they met in college. When my dad after my mom made a presentation, my dad, I guess, leaned over and was like, you know, I could tell you're really nervous, but today great and they just they seem to bond over this nervousness that they both had. Right? So there may be maybe a history, a family history of symptoms. like these, this distressing for you, you tried to avoid it and deal with it but you haven't been you don't feel you've been very successful coping with it. We'll get you in for treatment we'll catch in the next couple days to see a counselor. If that's what you'd like to do. Yes, please  think that could help. And I want to thank you for spending this time with me. It's really helped me to understand better what you're, you're facing.  Thank you. Thanks, Sasha.","The patient has had to give weekly presentations and it has been killing them for the past eight months. Though it is just for five minutes, they feel anxious.

2,"Summarize: How are you? Not well? No what's going on. Well, remember I had told you that they were downsizing at my job. I remember that. So I, you know, been there 20 years at my job. Yeah. And they're downsizing lately and they let me go. That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that. No, no, no. So yeah, it's just, you know, they let me go. I have really nothing to go on. I don't know what to do. I've been at that. job so long. I really don't know how to do anything else.  You should talk about the job. You're happy there. Yeah. I was, I thought, you know, I envision doing that job for a long time. So, you know, and that's not gonna happen. No, no. How does this affect your financial outlook like your bills and such? Oh, it's awful. I mean, we definitely my husband and I, it's really spiraled out of control. My husband and I have kind of like, joint, we pay the bills together. And so this was half of our income, and that's gone. And because it was kind of more sudden, we didn't really have time to do anything else, you know, time to prepare. So it definitely caught you off guard. Do you have enough income with your husband's job to cover your basic bills? were a little bit. Yeah, so far. But if I don't find the job soon, then I don't know what's gonna happen. I don't know how bad it's gonna get to know about how long you have for you fail to meet any financial commitments. My husband usually deals with the bills, so I'm not quite sure. But probably in another month or so it's going to get really bad for about a month. What thoughts have you been having? All sorts. I mean, I, I've worried that, you know, like, my husband and I are arguing because we're under all this stress. I worry, we're gonna lose our house. You know, I'm worried I'm going to be homeless. You know, it's embarrassing. I don't have a job now. What if I don't find another job? You know, what are my kids gonna do? My kids are, you know, relying on us to meet their needs. Yeah, yeah. So I mean, we could be homeless. I might not ever get a job again, you know, I'm not getting any younger. So I just am afraid that I won't get another job. Now, you said you were laid off, right?  Yeah. For the position. Are you eligible for unemployment? I'm not sure I'm still looking into that. Because if you I mean, I'm not a labor law expert. But I think if you're, if you're laid off, there's probably decent probability you could get on employment. How much for educational? I just have my bachelor's. Well, that's, that's more than most bachelor's degree. Yeah. You just haven't had to look for a job in a long time, right here. Because I'm guessing you thought you're gonna retire. Yeah So this is upsetting for a lot of reasons. So you have The financial stressors, right? I can't be minimized. The relational stressors mentioned, it's kind of embarrassing. Yeah, that's more like an identity thing I see identify with what you did right now. You don't as much, because you're not actively working in it. Yeah. Did you ever have any co workers who voluntarily left for other jobs? Not that No. Not at the time you worked there. Not that I was aware of that. I think maybe it maybe like one A while ago, but it was a pretty good job. So.  So a lot of people stay. Yeah. Have you ever known anybody who worked for a similar company or in the same field? Who change jobs? Yeah, one of my friends was in a similar field and he left the job and eventually found another job. You know how long it took. It took a while. It took a while. Like, maybe like two years or so at least almost, yeah, it was a struggle for their family. So I think about that would you need to replace that full income to pay your bills or part of that income? I mean, probably part of it maybe full would be ideal because, you know, we were comfortable the way we were living so far would be ideal, but you know, we could probably survive on on part of it, it just not as well as we were living. So we've talked about problem solving skills before in earlier sessions, right. So have you applied a those concepts to what's going on now. I mean, I've been trying to think of think of, you know, different opportunities that might be open to me now and you know, being able to spend more time with my kids and things like that. I've been trying to think of it other ways my situation. So there's sort of an upside, and then sense the time part, at some point need to replace the income. Yeah, that's very pragmatic in the money. Have you considered that if you attempted to seek a full time job to work out, you could look at part time jobs. I've thought about it, but I'm really having a hard time with it. What would it What would it mean about you? What would it say about you if you had to take a part time job, so finding another full time job is so much of the loss? What would it mean about me is That I think if I only had a part time jobs that I wasn't qualified, that I wasn't good enough for full time. So you would you would internalize that and Meaning would be that you're not as valuable. Yeah. So it speaks to self worth. Well, right now it's not good. Well, I mean, I've been arguing with my husband, I've been drinking a lot more, you know, the depression has come back a lot worse. So it's just starting to become the cycle where you know, drinking and getting into arguments and situations not getting better and it just keeps snowballing keeps snowballing. Yeah. And these these behaviors are all things that potentially could impede your goal. So it is kind of like a self fulfilling prophecy element to this. Yeah. Do you agonize you worry, invest in these thoughts? Right? And then to temporarily take away the pain you drink? Yeah. That ends up being more dysfunction, right with a relationship with your husband. Yeah. Imagine if you're intoxicated, you're not looking for new work. Yeah. That wouldn't be ideal timing. So, in a sense, you're, you're not helping things to improve. And it all kind of starts without thinking,  but it's hard when I'm really depressed and the situation's not getting better. And I'm just home sitting about, you know, drinking, while everyone else is carrying on with their life, and I'm stuck here. And that ties into that kind of worthless, type five. So you're fulfilling that role. worthless. That sounds manifesting for you. And that's one thing you can do. That's an option you can drink and you could have relational struggles. But is that really? Is that really what you want at all? Is that the most useful?  Really? No, it's not helping.  How do you think you could break that cycle? I've been thinking about, you know, trying to get more organized, like we talked about before with the finances and, and trying to, you know, figure out exactly how much income we need to be where we want, what to do and maybe by baby steps, so it's not like, so overwhelming for me like the thought of getting a new job and making enough money and providing for my family. And like breaking it down. Well, that makes sense. Yeah, so the first step would be figuring out what The minimum amount you really need, right? So you'll shoot for hire full time, but you realize that you kind of need to know what the minimum is because you know what job offer you could accept in which I want free time to decline. Right? So it makes sense. So armed with that information and you could go into the workplace, right? And it was less anxiety kind of just know this Job's gonna if I get it, that's good, right Lord, I might as well not apply to this one because it's not gonna work. So as efficient as time say, it's good. That sounds logical. I think just sometimes like the fear of the unknown, like, worry about what if this never happens for me? You know, what if I don't get a job? You know, what if we lose our house? That worries Yeah, no worries. nagging Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, worst case, if we don't get a job, I mean, probably. I don't know, like, get a smaller house, or find a way around it. I mean, she would need to have some tough times.  Yeah. It would be difficult, right? To be fair, right? It would be difficult, but you would adapt. Right? So like, it would be difficult but I think if I really thought about it, you know, we would probably get through it. So if we pick up with that we say that's really an adaptive response when we talk about adaptive responses to automatic thoughts, right? So if you're telling yourself that you have the depression and certainly anxiety, craving to drink, you tell yourself well, the worst that could happen is I don't work the rest of my life again, acknowledging that's pretty unlikely. But the worst thing to happen is I won't work again. And I might have to adapt, I might have to have a simpler life in terms of material goods and small house, but I would survive would affect my battery that have on on your mood, or your thoughts? I mean, I think when I really think about it, you know, like you said, I think I'm less depressed or think that I, you know, I'm more able to cope with it. You know, knowing Okay, well, this is the worst that could happen, but maybe it's not as bad as I thought. would be embed.  So there's a piece that comes with clarity that comes with accepting what the worst case scenario could be. Right? And probably another part of the adaptive response could be, you know, I could live to the worst case scenario. I think it's important to acknowledge that it's unlikely. that's unlikely. Right? So statistics probability is on your side here. Right? So, as you go out to the workplace and the workforce and seek employment, you'll probably have some, some interviews, we don't get a job offers, right. But eventually, if I have one where you do, yeah, right. It's, it's just math. Right? If you can accept the worst case that maybe reduce or limit that alcohol consumption, reduce that depression, anxiety. Yeah. So Let's end there for today. But I want you to try for the next week. I want to try plan that adaptive response, right? Actually, there's two we're talking about right? One is you could survive the worst case scenario. And the other one is that probabilistically It won't happen. Right? So you have kind of two. Well, you do have two adaptive responses I want you to apply when those automatic thoughts come up, like, I'm never gonna work again. Okay, this is a catastrophe. So like that self talk. Yeah, apply that self talk. So identify that automatic thought, because we've talked about that skill, right? And then apply that self talk right away. All right, and let's see, you have the thought record. Right. So when that you know, when you can fill one of those out, okay, when that happens when you have that automatic thought and you apply the adaptive response, even if you can't get it completely filled out, I understand that. I know there's a lot on there. Just what you can get done on that. Anything you can do. That would be helpful.  Okay. Sound good? Yeah So scheduled for one week. So I'll see you then we'll see how this goes to progress we can make on this on the alcohol and the depression and anxiety.

3,"Summarize: So, alright, let's take a step back and talk about competency. What education Did you need for the job you have now? I have my bachelor's degree. And we got a little bit of training. You know every so often we get some training at work and stuff like that. Are you evaluated at work by anybody to see if you're in a job you should be? Yeah, I have a supervisor so they check up on stuff and also like if I feel like I have questions and stuff like that, I can go to them as well. Have you been Found in that system to be somebody who's satisfying the requirements of in terms of competency satisfy the requirements of employee. Yeah, I mean, I haven't been fired. So that's a good sign again, that's a good sign. Yeah, you haven't been fired. Have you ever had any type of write up or somebody discussing something with you? No, I just I kind of feel like maybe the climate has changed a little bit at the office after this happened, like maybe other people think I didn't make the right decision. I guess maybe that's part of where all my doubts are coming from, like, no one has said to me and I have, you know, my supervisor hasn't called me in and said, I'm concerned about this, but I just feel like maybe  other people think that I did something wrong. Alright, so there's no there's no evidence supporting that. In a kind of a direct fashion, like a supervisor coming to, but there's no other evidence supporting it based on your, what you're feeling, how you're perceiving things. Yeah, you're getting this feeling that, by the way, they're interacting with you. Yeah. Which, I guess maybe I shouldn't be that freaked out about because there have been other people who have made mistakes and like, the supervisors have talked to them and, you know, even then they didn't lose their jobs. So it's not like, you know, I, you know, I don't know, I guess it's not like just hearing them, or thinking that they're judging me is an indication that something terrible is going to happen or that I made this huge mistake. Alright, so you can see that I'm talking this through you can see that. So some of this could be feelings. Thoughts you're having, combined with what you're actually observing share, you're filtering your observations in a way that's maybe making them seem a little more destructive, or more negative. Yeah, it's kind of like, I know, it's not that big of a deal because, like I said, My supervisor hasn't talked to me and it's not like I've heard anything terrible about anything happening to the kids or anything like that. But I just feel like, you know, I have those thoughts like, oh, was she you know, saying something? You know, when she said that? Did she was she referring to what happened? and stuff like that? Can you can you provide an example of an interaction with a coworker where where they said something that you thought maybe was referring back to this? Yeah. So like we were having like our regular work week. And we kind of like, you know, discuss how things are going. And it's been kind of a big deal what, you know, more so than usual that the kids were removed from this family. So, you know, one of my co workers kind of nudged me and said, like, oh, you're the bulldozer you, you know, you plowed right through that family took those kids away. And, you know, I think she meant it kind of, like as a joke and just, you know, maybe to say, like, you know, you did what you needed to do, but it kind of made me feel like does she think that I'm just callous? Like, does she think that I just didn't care and you get what I'm saying? So she referred to as a bulldozer. And one way to take that would be powerful, efficient. Another way to take that would be kind of destructive we talked about before destructive powers. They're mechanical they don't have a lot of feeling. Yeah. So you don't know exactly know how she meant it but you're thinking maybe it was negative yeah. And I guess it kind of like goes back to like my fear that I didn't think it through that I kind of just, you know, I made the report and that was that and, you know, it makes me feel like Was I being mechanical? Was I just was I just nonchalant about it? Should I have put more thought into it? And it really, you know, it hit me where it hurt I guess you know. So her saying that really kind of brought up this thought that maybe you are maybe you are not empathetic enough or compassionate enough. Or even just thoughtful. I guess maybe I was just being, you know, just going about my job without putting a lot of thought into What I was doing exactly. So, maybe one thing you would have done differently in light of that comment. At the time making a decision, you would have thought through the steps more. Yeah, maybe taking a little bit more time.",The patient has been concerned about the work atmosphere where they feel others think that the patient hasn't made the right decision.

And so I blame my mom for that because she used me as the scapegoat. And then my sister was like, Oh, well, that's the bad sister.

6,"Summarize: Afternoon. I'm glad you could get in today. I'm still anxious. Yes, last week when you were and you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety, and we had developed a plan a plan for your anxiety. And according to my notes, you were going to look into some yoga classes. You were going to attempt to drink less coffee. You were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home, and you were going to spend more time in nature. So I'm wondering how all that went? Well, I looked at the gym and there weren't really any yoga classes, so I didn't I didn't really do that. I did cut back on my coffee a little bit, but I just find that it wakes me up in the morning. So, you know, I've cut back to one cup instead of two cups. And I did take the dog for a walk. But I haven't really gotten out other than that. Okay, so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals. You did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes. You did cut down from two cups of coffee to one. And you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk. But it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue. Getting out more with people. Yeah, I don't. I don't really like to go out with people. There's usually a lot of a lot of chatter, a lot of talking and it's hard for me to be in. So it's uncomfortable for you to be To around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking, and how does that make you feel? It just makes me feel a little bit nervous. And then when I get out there, I don't really, I don't really engage in conversation. Okay, so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious. So I'm wondering what we could do about that. I'm not really sure maybe I could invite people over instead. That would absolutely be one option. You could invite people over to your house, and then you could get to choose who you're around. Yeah, that's a good idea. And in terms of the yoga, let's get back to the yoga for a minute. Tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes. Well, I just looked at my gym. I didn't really look anywhere else because I'm already paying To go to a gym, and I don't really want to pay extra to go somewhere else. So that's why I didn't really look anywhere else.  Mm hmm. And so if I were to ask you right now, how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to 10? Maybe about a five or six. Okay. Um, well, I, I see all these pictures in my newsfeed about yoga and I see all these pictures and I just want to do it. So I'm interested in doing it, it's just really hard. So when you see the pictures on your newsfeed, it makes you excited about doing it. But when you actually go to do it, it makes it more challenging.  Well, I haven't done it before. So it's a little bit hard to get out there because I don't think I'm as flexible Other people? Mm hmm. And so you're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people. I'm wondering if that's what Yoga is about flexibility? Well, I think I think that people go to become flexible. But I think that maybe some people are already just flexible. Mm hmm. So you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest? Yeah. And you'd be a beginner? Well, I'm worried I wouldn't be able to do the poses in class.  Okay. So what do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class? Well, I feel embarrassed, I think. And then if the teacher tried to get me to do it, and everybody else would see that they're trying to get me into a pose, and I think it would be embarrassing. Okay. So you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain policies. And how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class I think I feel really good. And so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class? Right? I guess it's just the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it. What would what would cause you to not being able to do it? The causes are not we're not sure. Okay. I remember when you first came in last week, you told me that when you were younger, you used to be very, very flexible. And I'm wondering, what would make that difference between then and now? Well, when I was a kid, I used to just practice a stretch a lot, and now that I don't, I don't have the same flexibility. Mm hmm. So as I've gotten older, I've lost a lot of flexibility and How would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed? I mean, it would be okay. But I don't I don't like that feeling. What would be the payoff? Do you think? If you put up with a little bit of embarrassment? Well, I probably feel really good in the end. You know, I can give you I've lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down. As a matter of fact, some studies show that anxiety, doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications. So I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not. I didn't really know that. I just thought that that you'll go was For about flexibility, I didn't realize there were so many other benefits. Okay. So how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to 10? Well, I probably, if I thought that I'd be it would make me less anxious, I think I'd probably be around an eight or nine. Good, good. That's a definite improvement. And, and you could determine after that first class, whether your anxiety levels have decreased or not. And that, would that be validation for you? Or would that be? It gives you even more motivation? If your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class? I think that would be a lot of motivation to continue.  Okay. So one other thing that I wanted to, to mention to you was, you said that you'd walk your dog in nature and curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature. Wow. It was only about 30 minutes. It was really cold and windy. So we didn't want to stay out. And by we I mean the dog and I Mm hmm. And so because of it, it was cold and windy. You decided to kind of cut the walk short. Yeah. And and that's definitely understandable. I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day. Wow. It might help if I take a jacket next time. Okay, so if you took a jacket in cases cold, yeah. And do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful, that you could be in that would help you even more. Enjoy it as long as I'm just away from road noise and traffic and then it's a lot better. Okay, and there's lots of trails around my house like that. Okay, excellent. Is It's great that you have trails around your house where you're not exposed to all that noise. Probably. And on a scale of one to 10 tell me what that probably means. It's probably attend. I can I can commit to that. Okay. All right. So it sounds like last week, you had a few problems carrying out the assignments towards decreasing your anxiety. You really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes. But you already know about the yoga videos that I've sent you so you could actually do them at home. Yeah,  you how strongly do you feel about doing them at home? If I could do them at home, I would probably do them all the time. Mm hmm. I think that would be a big difference.  And then there would be no embarrassment factor. If you couldn't do the poses less coffee, you've gone from two cups to one cup that's very good. And get out more with people, you've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who's going to be in your space. That's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know you have no control over who's going to be in your space. And on a scale of one to 10 you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog? I think it's a 10. I think I can do them on all four all four. Fabulous and how do you think you feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week of the course of next week? How much of a difference Do you think it would make you feel? Perfect it maybe even make me look forward to doing these things if I were doing them on a regular basis. Mm hmm. And how would it make you feel? It would make me feel really good. And so you'd feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and I think you would do. Thank you so much.","The patient feels anxious.

So your mood is moods up. They your brother specifically had concerns about spending money. I mean, he's worried because I went on a shopping spree so he doesn't really know how much I am making with this new promotion and I don't really want to tell him I might I might actually because I'm proud of myself like I deserve it and I you know, we're still hard for so long in this company. And so with the shopping spree was kind of like treating myself. And so I've gone I went out and I did spend a lot of money. I actually maxed out one of my credit cards, but I don't have a lot of bills right now. Like I paid off all my debts, and I finished paying off my student loans too, so I could pay for it. So that's why he's worried. And like, I called him because I ran out of space in my car, and I was going to try to put this table that was gonna buy on top of my car bins and have like one of those things to attach it. So it didn't work out. And so I think you kind of got worried because he thought I was buying too much, but I returned that item because obviously I couldn't fit in my car and he couldn't come help me.

Um, yes and no. I mean, yes, because I haven't really been sleeping as much as I used to. I think I used to sleep too much. But like, I haven't needed to this week, like, but it hasn't been an issue.

9,"Summarize: Alisa How you doing today? Good? How are you? I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. How has the anxiety been going? Um, since last session, it seems to be in check. Nothing really major. It's been going on with it. So I think I'm getting to a point where it's under control. I subsided a bit. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How's things been going at work lately? So works a little bit of a different story. Um, we have our daily meetings, and I actually had to clean like one of my co workers aside because I feel like they undermine me all the time. And they like, they don't give me the respect basically, that I deserve. So I took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it. And afterwards, I mean, the next day, because we have these things every day, and she like, she came back and came at me again. But it was worse, even after talking for no. So you have these, someone understands you have these daily meetings? Right. And you mentioned that she's not showing you respect and that you deserve respect. Right? effect. So tell me, tell me about that. Believe from what we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences. In our abt, tell me about that belief. Or I just feel that I do a good job and I deserve to be respected by my coworkers. Yeah, it just other levels of respect. There's a certain level of respect that you demand or need. I don't know if there's a certain level, but I feel just like, I deserve it. You know, and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect? Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. So I just I didn't understand. right I mean, I guess. Have you criticized other coworkers? yeah. So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you've kind of seen there regularly I mean, now that you pointed out I mean, I guess I can view it in that way that it wasn't. it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were Yeah. I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonable at the time when you were? when I was talking to her outside of the meeting. So you felt that she was a bit harsh. You talk to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. So where do you stand with her now? Like the meeting? Well, I've just been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help.  It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation? So I guess the confrontation I had whether Was this criticism? Yeah. Yeah. So She criticized me and I felt disrespected. That's a feeling I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect. being upset and like disrespected and again yeah  was aggravation, yeah. frustration, frustration. So that's, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. Does that make sense? Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences? Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office. To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over,  like confronted her,  you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you. Does that make some some sense? It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel. Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking. So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair? Yeah. Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that. I mean, I understand But you're saying I get it? I guess it's just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on. It's just getting there.  Mm hmm. Do you are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance? Yes. Yeah. Tough though just as you mentioned, like what the inside says tough How long have you had this belief cuz mentality of I deserve respect. Oh gosh, Um, since I was like a teenager. So long time this has been a relatively persistent part of your life. Let's play system. So changing it's going to be work. So, if you can apply a different philosophy apply more flexible thinking? Next time you're in a meeting, she still criticized you in the meetings.  Yeah. So if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be, I'm being disrespected again. I it probably comes on that way. You kind of feel it. Yeah, it, it starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up. So it'll be your first physiological reaction, right and emotional reaction. But if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking, like I talked about, right, which is, I'd like respect, right. But I can survive and function without it. At some level, I can accept that. I'm not going to get it all the time. Other other areas of life for you do get respect.  Yeah. For my friends and my family, I feel I feel like they give me. it's actually mutual respect. They give me respect I give them respect and Well, I think over time, if I learned to do that I first starting like within side of me like I wouldn't get that initial Like, punched in the gut. And I wouldn't have the urge to lash out at her. Especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there's that tension in our office. I'd be able to do that I think I'd be able to approach her and maybe ask her she'd want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind of talking with her. maybe I misunderstood her in the first meeting. And she really didn't mean to undermine me as I said, and then go from there. So either way, gathering the information, meaning having a discussing discussion with her, it would be helpful because I mean, you may find that you really see things so like, and it was just a disagreement in terms of her criticism in the way you interpreted, or she may have been trying to be critical and you'll know that to be really Can't control someone else's behavior. But it will give you an idea of maybe what our intentions were and how you can go forward to repair that relationship so that it functions.  Yeah. I certainly don't want like, our upper management to, you know, get involved and there'll be a bigger issue. You don't want them to have to come and sort that out. Right, you can sort out their own. And that would be a good application of coping skills and flexible thinking. So is that something you feel like you can try over the course of the next week? I will definitely try. So really our plan move forward as a couple parts. So one would be smooth things over and sensitive, discussing this with her, letting her know you're aware what's going on and you want to try to resolve it and the second part would be Trying to move a little bit away from the rigid, you know, I deserve respect to, I would like respect but I'll function adequately without respect from everyone. I know that's tough. That's gonna be that's gonna be the challenge, right? But this will be this will give us good information and give you some practice. Does it all make sense to you? Yeah, it's pretty clear. You explained it really well. Thank you. So, let's work on those two, those two elements. Right and next time you come in, we'll check in on those two and make any needed modifications to our strategy and we'll kind of move forward from there.  Okay,  that sounds good. Sounds great.

It's not good and it will ruin your life I mean it was just the like a social gathering it wasn't like I was looking for it the drinks were there and I all my friends were doing it and it was just it's it's not something that I like do okay on occasion but whenever the opportunity presents itself it it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes I Tommy there's so many consequences with drinking you know you're not even 21 yet you could get arrested you could you know have a drunk driving accident you could you know, mess up your schoolwork you have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really really concerns me. I get what you're coming from but I I really did. I thought that I had it under control. And I didn't let myself get too far gone. I didn't want to be in how do I put this little Like, I want it to be in control. And I wanted to make sure that all my friends were Okay, so I didn't let myself drink too much. There's really no such thing as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're under age is drinking too much. You know, like, think about it. Think about all the things that can happen to you. Yeah, I understand exactly what you're saying. And how much are you drinking? I don't think I'm drinking that much. I mean, it's, it's mainly for social gatherings. Like it's nothing that I do, like by myself or whatever. It's just the it's like, every weekend. every other weekend, I would say, Tommy, I'm just so concerned, you know, can't you think of anything better to do? I guess I can, I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I do get where you're coming from. Yeah, are your friends the problem? Like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with? Yeah, I guess I haven't really put it on myself, I guess it's really been forced on their account. And I've just been following in their footsteps just to just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun. And I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can. Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here. Yeah, I, I do see that. Maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I It does make a lot of sense. And I, I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking.  I think you really need to quit. Yeah, I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I, I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely. I don't I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life. Think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, I wish you would quit. If all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. It's really important. Yeah, I, I just I don't see the problem in it right now. And maybe it's because I haven't really had that dramatic of an experience. But, um, do you want to wait for that to happen? Do you want to wait for a dramatic experience? You're right. I don't want I don't want to be too far gone. Before it's too late. Like I, I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I I guess I've never really had any, any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much, or affected anybody close to me that much. So I guess it's something that I feel like I'm in control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think. All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get to trial here and stop drinking. Yeah, I think that that would be a good step forward into an A life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol. Okay.

11,"Summarize: Alright, so let's see if we could just talk about the moment of the presentation again. I want to try to help you develop some strategies to bring those anxiety symptoms down.  Okay, right.  Let's actually go right before the moment so you're still in the, you're still sitting down, and you're getting ready to present. Let's just say your second present. Yeah, like we've talked about and you're thinking they're going to seeming as anxious. They're gonna think I don't belong here. These are the right. Okay. So these thoughts occur because you have an expectation rule one add to that you brought into that class, when you walked into that class, you have these expectations already. It's perfectly natural. It's not right or wrong. Everyone has these beliefs. And whenever these beliefs are and we'll talk about that another point, they combined with the stressor of having this presentation in front of you, right, and the classmates watching you, and they result in these thoughts. We call them automatic thoughts,  okay  And just like the beliefs, they're not good or bad. They don't say anything about the person having them. They're just thoughts. Actually, they're fairly understandable and natural thoughts. The problem is that they lead to symptoms. So, you're sitting there at your desk, and you're thinking, they're gonna see that I'm anxious. They're gonna realize I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough, right? What reaction Do you have when you have that far? I guess I'm like very observant, like I started looking around, like, I'm sweating. Like I'm having physical responses, and I'm looking around to see if anyone's already looking at me, like hyper vigilance. so distressing symptoms. Yeah. What's something that you could send yourself in that moment, that would maybe get in between that thought, and that reaction, so that thought of, I'm not gonna know I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough. And that reaction I mean, I think in that moment, most people are looking at the person who's presenting and not at me. And so that, you know, I can maybe like, take some deep breaths or try to calm myself down. Maybe like look over my notes one more time. Because they're all watching the person who is presenting not me. Okay. So some some deep breathing, looking over your notes, like preparing yourself for kind of focusing on that and realizing they're not really looking at you anyway for a moment. Okay, good. Good. Um, you bring your notes with you to class? I mean, like usually have like index cards, or maybe like some stats on something that I want to look over like some numbers or something I don't want to forget. Okay. So You always have those with you. Yeah. It's just a matter of can you focus your attention on them? Right, exactly enough to not forget them. And you know, if you're focusing on that, and you're thinking about that, you're not thinking about whatever they might be thinking about Right, exactly. And how about the deep breathing? Is that a strategy you've tried before? a little bit, but with not much success, because usually when I think to remember it, I'm in, you know, panic mode, and then it's really hard.

12,"Summarize: HI Sam, Thanks for waiting. I talked to your mom a little bit about some of the things that were going on at home in school. And now I'm going to spend a few minutes with you asking you some questions. The questions I ask all the kids, some of them are going to kind of fit for you and some of them might not fit so well. But if there's things that you're curious about, I'm asking or if you have questions as we're talking, then feel free to ask me about why I'm asking something or ask any questions. Okay.

Lots of stressors and lots of things that have happened hasn't Mom doing with all of that stuff. Okay, and I guess she's fine. Have there ever been a time where you feel like your mom isn't able to get out of bed or do the things that she needs to do? No. No. So she's getting out of bed and she's looking after you. Most of the time most of the time, they won't watch us most of the time mean? Well, she's mostly doing a lot of well, she's doing a lot of stuff. So she's doing things pretty quick, I guess. What are some of the things that you might think she might do a bit better? pretty much every day, Is your mom having Cheerios with you? Are you on your own having Cheerios what your mom doing mainly by myself. you're by yourself having Cheerios. No not really Okay. And if you've been worried about having food it's ever been a concern of yours no among keep saying that, we'll make go mall go shopping for one but we never end up doing it because she's too busy of things. So how's your mama doing? Okay, I guess pretty good Are there ever any times that she seems down or upset for days at a time that she hasn't been getting out of bed? For that she seems to be having a really tough time. Lately a little bit stressed because of grandma. Can you tell me more about what you mean by a little bit stressed? So they've been arguing and yelling. So who has grandma and mom? Yeah, they've been arguing and yelling. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Well, they're just arguing about things are not very nice. I haven't listened to it very much. I just go to my room, so it's not very nice. And when they are you and yell, have there ever been times that you've been afraid that someone might get hurt? Once, maybe, once? Can you tell me a bit about that time? Or they were just getting really mean like, more than they usually would. Because it's happening quite a bit now. I wasn't, wasn't too bad. I guess. So the fighting between your grandma and your mom, how intense does it get? Is it arguing or is it yelling, screaming? When they are human? Have there been times when anybody's been physical use their fists or hands? No. Any other way that they may have physically been fighting? No, no.  What about throwing objects or no? No. And what happens to you when they're fighting? Where are you? I just go to my room and try to ignore it. Just so you're going to hear from me and knowing kind of what happens afterwards. They kind of just stay away from each other for a while. Okay. So when they're fighting, it's what I'm hearing is it's words, Well, sometimes my grandma's criticizing me a little bit. Like she'll tell me I'm not doing something right, but then help me with it. Like, explain it. So you're feeling criticized by grandma. What about mom? Has she ever said mean or hurtful things to you? No Sam, has anybody touched your body in an inappropriate way or a way that you didn't like? What do you mean? Has anyone touched your private parts or touched you in a sexual way? Sam, does anybody in your house ever hit or spank you? What about hurting your body as anyone hurt your body?

So you don't have any worries about your parents using drugs or alcohol? What about Grandma, anybody else in your family that you're worried about in that way? So Sam, how do you feel in your close relationships? Do you feel loved and cared about and special? Or my mom pays more attention to my little brother. And then when I try to talk to my mom, if I want something she really like. She don't really listen that well. She just kind of keep doing what she's doing. And then might later asked me again, what to do more. Not a lot, though. Rarely at any time.  So you're not feeling loved? Is there any place in your life with any adults or with anyone that you're feeling love? Like me in my room? I don't really have anyone else no. So if you had a problem, or you were hurt in some way or something was happening, who would you go to for help? Or what would you do? I don't have anybody should go to my room and think. Like, I just like being in my room sometimes. And is anybody in your family ever been in jail or in prison? So the stressors in your house and what's going on? Making your mom not be there for you as much? no What are what do you think of some of those stressful things? Well, probably because my grandma's fighting and also my dad moving away, because they were divorced. That's right. You want to go your mom told me that you You and your mom aren't together anymore and that he's moved out to BC to see your dad. Now, when was the last time you saw him a year ago? Is there a plan for you to see him? No, no. What I've heard is that, you know, there's some stressors and some things that are hard for you in your life.

That, that your dad has moved away, that you're not always in the right clothes and you have to fix some of your meals. And that you're not always feeling loved and special.

That you're not worried about your mom emotionally and that she's not worried about her all the time. Struggling more emotionally? And that nobody you know is in prison, or has been in prison now. And you don't have any concerns about drugs or drinking or in your home? Sam, do you think some of those stressors are what's making it hard for you at school? I think so. Probably. Yeah. Why do you think that might be? A because I'm thinking about that. And then I'm not like thinking about what I'm doing and then no, get very much I know that a lot of that makes a lot of sense, Sam, that when things are stressful at home that kids have trouble concentrating and it affects them at school.

Um, you know, about a week ago, I went out with some friends to a boxing match and I didn't really want to go I've never I've never really been to one. It's not really something I'm interested in. But I was just hanging out with my friends and stuff. Yeah, I watched a few fights in this this one fight sky. He nothing was really happening. I wasn't really into it. But this guy got knocked out right in front of me. It was really close to The ring got knocked out right in front of me fell right on his face. And I just saw him lifeless in front of me. And I just never said sons have been saved. I had to leave right away. I just couldn't. Couldn't be there anymore. And what did you notice right away so, so one of the boxers was sounds like knocked out a noose. You saw that. What did you notice right away was happening. I just felt really, really scared. You know, my heart started racing. I kind of didn't really know. I couldn't focus on what was going on around me. I just had to get out there. So you know, I don't even really know what happened to him if he was okay or not. So I just couldn't handle how I was feeling so I had to leave So you left and the symptoms, they continued. Yeah, pretty much daily for the past week. I got home that night. I couldn't sleep You know, it took me almost all night to fall asleep and then at work on Monday, I was having a lot, a lot of problems there. What was that about? I couldn't focus on anyone was talking to me at a meeting on Tuesday. And my boss was you know, talking for a while and I just, I felt like I couldn't concentrate at all you know, everything is kind of just a blur around me. I do find that you're having memories of the, the incident of the boxing match that are Kind of intrusive. Yeah, I think about it a lot. Pretty much all the time. But I suppose some for you.  Yeah if I'm at work trying to get some paperwork done or something, it just pops in my mind and I can't make it go away.  And you try but you Yeah, remember any dreams related to it? I haven't really been dreaming about it barely sleeping any times when you feel like you're reliving what you saw like you're seeing it again. No not really just think about it a lot Does anything keep reminding you of the boxing match? And then that's causing you to have symptoms? Yeah. With my meeting, people started clapping. You know was big cheering and That kind of made me feel really, really bad again, my heart was racing, start sweating and just kind of reminded me of being there and start thinking about it again. So, things like that, you know, pump up music when it comes on the radio, same kind of music they played there. Kind of makes you feel the same way my heart starts to race. It just kind of feel like I need to get away from it. Do you find yourself working to avoid like, music too similar? Yeah. I've been trying to avoid the radio because you never know what's going to come on on the radio. So I've been avoiding listening to music in case something like that happens and putting crowds Do you find that you've had any trouble remembering what happened? No, I can. I can pretty vividly remember it. It's pretty clear to you Have you been irritable at all since the incident? Yeah, you know, just out of nowhere. Something doesn't go the way I wanted to I just kind of snap on people. And that's not like me at all. I usually am pretty easygoing. And, you know, people, my boyfriend, for instance, right? I yelled at him the other day for not putting the toilet paper on the roll. And that's not something I'd usually care about. It's just, it's not me. How about your awareness level of what surrounds you? Do you find that your awareness level has increased that you're, you're more aware? kind of depends. Sometimes I kind of feel like I'm in a daze and don't really know what's going on around me. But um, I've been one of the students that I work with the the pop up out from behind the door, which he would do all the time. And you know, typically, I would laugh and think it was funny before but he did the other day and I just could not control myself afterwards. Like, I couldn't calm myself down. You know, I didn't think was funny at all. It really, really scared me. And that went on for about 1015 minutes and I just my heart was racing. I had to go take a walk and just really hard to relax and after that, so you feel like your reaction to that was stronger than it normally would have been? Definitely. Have you used drugs or alcohol recently?  No, no Any medical problems? No So Jackie, I'm going to get you in to see a counselor here at the agency if that's something that you're okay with. Yeah, I think that would be really helpful. Just take a couple days to get you on to get you in to see somebody to get you on the scheduling agenda, see somebody and I'll get that arranged.

14,"Summarize: Jason, how you doing, sir?  Okay. You all right? I'm just here. You're just here, just here. I understand that you're in the hospital a couple weeks ago. Yeah, I was in the hospital about two weeks ago did something and I had to go to the hospital afterwards. What happened? yeah, so about two weeks ago, I was finishing up this wonderful machine that I was creating in my room, so that the government can't hear my thoughts or my, my actions or my behaviors. And I was just trying to finish up my last little bit that I needed to build and I went over to the neighbor, because their garage was open and just picked out a tool and brought it back to the house. And when I was in the house working on my my room, the cops came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. So it's like, see the government data to get what you think the government is trying to do. They're trying to stop me from actually creating my room. Because they're, they're creating this new order where they want everybody to follow them. And I'm not a follower. And I know what I want. And I know what I need. And I know what my family wants, and I know what they need. And I'm just trying to protect them by creating my room. And tell me about your room. What what are you doing there that makes that special. So I was smart enough to know that there are frequencies and waves that are out there that the government is actually sending you through the lights and also through the TV and like through every electronic apparatus that is out there. And I'm actually creating doll or a wave neutralizer so that it can actually stop that from happening. So that you can actually live the life that you want and be happy and youthful and joyful all the time. Is that how you were feeling when you were building? Yeah, because I created this prototype in my room. And anytime I'm basically in there I was, it was good. I had energy. I didn't have everything that I wanted. But my prototype was running out of fuel. And so I needed to make it bigger, larger, so it can run longer. That's what you're trying to do Yeah, that's what I was trying to do when I wouldn't borrowed the tools from my neighbor but yeah, and then also I was ordering some things that were online. And they were also supposed to become be shipped in so that the base piece that I was creating, that I use the tools for my neighbor's house. It could have been all perfect and set so that when All of the hard drives in the electrical wiring and all of that stuff came in, I could just plug it in. And then not only my room covered, but also my houses covered and all of my family, they could just be happy. They could be happy, they could be happy, like, you know, you were happy. I was happy, like, so two weeks ago, I was I was good. I, I was up, I did all the calculations that I need to create. So I can actually build my base in my system. But then I also did the calculations about the different types of waves being in the house, but then also out of the house, that I also had the opportunity to just not sleep because I need sleep. I wasn't tired. And if I did sleep, I slept for like 15 minutes, just because I needed to finish what I was going to do. And I was so close to finishing and my neighbour called cops. So you had a period of time when you had like a lot of energy and you weren't really sleeping much Doesn't everybody do that? You're also happy and felt energetic I felt good. Like when I when I sleep I don't like when I sleep because it just feels wrong. And how do you feel now in comparison? I'm alright guy. All right. Just All right, right now. The government maybe get on different medication. So just all right. So not happy or sad. not sad either. It's just you In the middle Do you want to get back to that happiness of course who doesn't want to get back to the happiness of their life. That's the reason why you need to finish machine Yeah. You mentioned you ordered some products online. How much did you order? um, I think I ordered probably know the exact number I ordered 236 hard drives, because 236 is the perfect number that I needed to not only cover my bedroom, so I can always be happy and if the system went down, my room was always going to be covered. But then within that 236 it also covered my house so that my family could be happy, and like my four neighbors around us so we can all be happy. And that's the reason why I'm kind of angry at my one neighbor because I was including his house in all By my grid so that he can also be happy all the time. He would have been affected by a machine. Of course, he's the helping hand. He helped me out. He let me borrow his tools. but evidently he didn't let me borrow him this time. So just pull him out. Have another neighbor take his place. Were all those hard drives fairly expensive? I don't know. When I was up cleaning and running around the house trying to find more equipment. I found my mom's purse and I was just like, oh my god, she has a credit card in there. Oh my god, I can use our credit card. So I was using our credit card because it's trying to make her happy. And so I don't know I added the 236. They were probably 50 to $100 apiece, depending on where it could get them and I just ordered them. How'd your mother respond to that? My mom came to the hospital and was like, where are all these boxes coming from? It's like this, but I'm in my room. And she put them into my room. And then, like a week ago, she has, like, I see my credit card, and she wants to happen. Is that strange relationship? No, that's just how we have a relationship generally you get along, okay.  we get along perfectly fine. Like that's, that's how we talk to each other. Like, we talk to each other minimally, because she's not in my room, so she's not happy. So anytime she does come into my room, it messes up the balance. So I get unhappy, and then I just tell her to stay out so that I can be happy and she can be happy in her own place. And you mentioned that they changed medications in the hospital. The government changed for Medications How are you feeling about taking your medications? while so Right, you you really want to get back to work on that machine. Yes, I want to be back in my happy place.  Have you found yourself as motivated these last couple weeks as you were before you're hospitalized? Now? I haven't been that motivated. Big. I know I'm going to get it done. It's just I just don't know if I'm gonna get it done today or tomorrow, but I know what's gonna get done. You still want to get that done. It's important to know. it's really important because I Can't be controlled by the government anymore. by Jason, I'd like you to continue seeing a counselor here. If you found the counsellor to be helpful. The Counselor has been okay. But that okay, it's been okay. But we'll continue to counseling and hope that can can help you a bit. I appreciate you spending this time with me and explain what happened.  Thank you.","The patient was building a machine in their room so that government cannot hear their thoughts, actions or behaviors. The cops came and took the patient to the hospital.

15,"Summarize: Jackie, I joined today. Okay, how about you? I do well, thanks for asking.  I understand you've been having some difficulties recently that have brought you into the agency. Yeah, I'm, I'm recently married. And so my husband and I moved in together. And up until then I I've lived by myself. My whole adult life. So apparently the craziest things have been happening. While I've been sleeping. several, several nights I've woken him up screaming. I'm screaming. Apparently a very vulgar, profane, profane the words and So that's a little alarming to him. And I've even, you know, we've been hitting him in the middle of the night. You know, he's waking up with these huge bruises on his arms. And so yeah, apparently, a behavior in the middle of the night is out of hand. So I can understand why that would be distressing. Have you seen a physician about this? Yes. Um, I participated in a sleep study and what they say they rolled out some some other things and thought that maybe it was a behavior, Sleep Disorder. So they have referred me to you, I'm still working with them. Now. They're still running some tests and everything but they thought maybe there are some other stressors or underlying things, so that might be going on. So what would you like from counseling? Colby? Um, well, I'm just little worried that it's going to affect my marriage and that my husband will not be able to deal with that. So I would just really like to figure out how to keep my relationship with Him successful with it. So overcome these issues. So, after you were yelling things, or you hit him, like you're asleep during this time, when you wake up, what's going through your mind then? Usually I wake up and he's like, what are you doing? I was having the worst dream. So those dreams are kind of what he's telling me are aligning. What my behavior is, my dreams are aligning with those. So you know, I don't feel anything. It doesn't feel like I've been anything. I have. I've met a couple times and woken up, but no people do that. So I didn't really think anything of it. But now I'm starting to wonder. Yeah, it's it's a little strange. So Oh, concerning. Sorry. I wonder if you have this disorder before? Yeah, I mean, I would, I wouldn't have known. I've lived by myself. But you know, I, before I had fallen out of bed a couple times, and, you know, my sheets and pillows are always everywhere when I wake up, but I didn't really think anything of it. So kind of making the connections now. So he's been paying attention to what's going on with your sleep. Does the episode of yelling or moving around, does it happen a certain time limit? Like what happened right after you go to sleep or a while after you go to sleep? I'm in the middle of the night he has. He said at first he thought I was joking around But, yeah, no, no, I am waking him up, you know. So does that ever happen when you take like a nap for a short nap? No. Not that I know that he's, he's usually around electronic cash snapping he says it hasn't happened and so. Alright. So only at night when you're sleeping overnight and in the middle of that sleep. All right, would you be okay with sign a release so I can communicate with your question.  Yeah. And do you want your husband to be part of the counseling? Yeah, that would probably be helpful for him to kind of get this side of things too. And you'd be okay saying release for him? Yes, yes. So I'll get you scheduled into see a counselor. I appreciate you tell me what's going on.  It's been it's been helpful. Thank you. Prepare health",The patient is suffering from sleep disorder.

16,"Summarize: Okay, a great job on your homework was really excellent. He listened to the imaginal exposure recording about six times. And you did the exposure, the in vivo exposure of walking around and touching things like doorknobs and other surfaces and objects you normally wouldn't touch both at your house and other places you went, and you sat down on the floor, and you even ate lunch off the floor at your house and at your mom's house. Okay, and no washing, no wash, no, no hand washing, no extra washing. Perfect. Good for you. Okay, so what did you learn from all that? Do you think over the course of the time you've done that? It just got easier. At the beginning. It was really hard. And I feel like my stats were much higher than the end. So I guess that was what we talked about the habituation, habituation, right? Yeah. The fact that when you do something like that, that initially makes you anxious, and you do it repeatedly, especially in for prolonged periods of time. Your anxiety comes down, right? We're just not built to stay in definitely anxious. Okay. You notice any other changes or anything else? I noticed that before doing the exposures, I was really, really anxious. And then it kind of went down, like the anticipatory anxiety that we also discussed. Right. Did that change by so yesterday? Yeah. So you're saying you're not only notice that it went down during the exposure, but you started feeling less anxious even approaching instead? Good? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. All right. Good. Okay. All right. So you're doing so well. We're going to take another step up the hierarchy today like we planned, right. Okay. So this is the dog leash day. You bring it? Yeah. Okay, good. All right. We'll get to that later in the session. First, we're going to do some imaginal exposure. Okay? And you remember what the purpose of that is? Why Why are we going to do imaginal exposure? That way I can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious and eventually deal with the fear consequence of getting sick in my case right. So the idea is, this is how we are able to have you have exposure to or sort of a confrontation in imagination with the consequences you fear of touching things that are contaminated and not washing, doing your rituals. Right. Okay, perfect. So did you write the story?  I would say like a 70. Okay. All right. Go ahead and start when you're ready. Should we press play? Thank you for reminding me to start the recording. So you have that for homework. Okay. So I'm in my house and the dog starts barking, and I know that that means that I have to take him out. I really don't want to so I'm thinking maybe I should wait until Joe gets home and he can do it. But I know the dog keeps barking, he's gonna wake up the baby. So I decided to go to the front door and get a leash. I'm not going to wear the gloves they usually wear so I feel we experienced touching the leash. But I'm already feeling really anxious. And I look at the leash and I see that it's gross and full of hair and the dog has been biting on it and in probably has saliva and other things and I see stains and Miss test thinking or if that's dog poop and I get sick and I just feel myself shaking and really sweaty. And my heart is beating really fast. So I'm feeling really, really anxious but I push myself and I grab leash, and I get the dog, open the door, go out and grab the leash. Okay let me now your stress level like 90  Okay, you're doing great, just keep going. So I grab the leash, and the dog is pulling and I feel the lease kind of pushing through my skin and I'm thinking all the bacteria that's getting there and I'm going to get sick, wanna vomit, but I just keep going. So I walk the dog, come back home, and I just leave the leash in the front door. And I'm thinking, I'm probably going to get sick. I really want to wash my hands. I really want to take a shower. But I try not to and I stopped myself. And I'm feeling really, really anxious. So I can't stop thinking about washing. So I tried to go to bed. Decided to fall asleep. The next morning I wake up, and I already feel sick. I know I'm sick. I'm shivering and I'm, I feel like I have a fever and I'm shaking again and I'm really nauseated. So I go to the bathroom, start vomiting. And I know I'm sick. I already got something I should have washed. I started thinking about that. Going to get the baby sick. And I feel really, really sick. Okay, great job. What's your level now? Like 80. Okay. All right. So just keep visualizing this. I'm going to describe it now. And you just stay with that image as much as you can. So you're in the house and the baby's sleeping and you're trying to get some housework done and do things for dinner. Suddenly, you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart rate kind of jumps up and you get upset and anxious because you know, that means He needs to go out. And Joe is not going to be home for hours. And you really don't want to take him out. But you have to. And it makes you sick and tired and upset, because you're not going to use the gloves that you always use when you have to take them out. So you walk toward the door, and you think, well, maybe I'll just make them wait. But you realize how wake the baby up if you don't take. So you go toward the leash, and it just makes you even more anxious to see it. And it's dirty. And it's chewed up, and it's gross, and you see stains on it. And you think about what those are from and maybe they're from dog poop and that's going to get on you. And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar. And as you go out the door and he lunges outside, he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash, entering your body, through the pores of your skin and you feel like it's just running up your arm through your bloodstream. And you keep thinking oh my god, what if I get sick from this What if What if there's some germs in this or bacteria, but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do and bring him back inside the house. Take the leash off. And the urge to wash is so powerful, so strong, you want to go scrub your hands and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these terms off from the leash. But you don't do that. You know, to make yourself not do the ritual. And then you go back in then just keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that's the sense of feeling sick, is staying with you and worrying about what's going to happen if you picked up germs from the leash. At night you go to sleep, still anxious, still upset about what happened. Wake up in the morning. And then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you're sick, you can feel your body being sick, you rush to the bathroom and vomit You can feel the fever and the time your body is just not not right. You're sick. And you know, it's because you handled that lesion didn't wash, you didn't do the washing you needed to do. And now you're sick and the baby will probably get sick. And if only you had done the washing, okay? What's your level now? Like 80 Okay. Okay, you take it back and you do it again. Okay. Good job. Okay, so, I'm home. The dog starts barking","The patient has listened to imaginal exposure recording six times.

Well, I don't know. They're just I don't know what I think they want me out. I think they're, I think they're testing me. And they're trying to, they're trying to find out how far they can push me basically. It's all part of some, some tests. I want to know what for, you know, you'd have to ask them. That's what I've said to the police time and time again. I've said to him Why Why are you asking me these questions? Why don't you just talk to them? You said your phone was clicking What was that about? a landline. Yeah, yeah. Somebody rings me or I ring somebody between seven and 10 seconds in. I click, click, click, click, click click every time.  Any other explanation for that?  I don't know. Well, well, if could be but you know, every single time and then and then they're talking to me, and then they know what I've been saying down the phone. You know, where are they talking to you? Well, I can hear him next door. Always on the phone again, always reading that book again. You know, I can hear him saying it. And they know that I can hear them and that's why they're doing it. Okay, so just to summarize at this point, your your phones Something's happening to telephone, you can hear your neighbors talking about what you're doing, making a commentary on your actions every day, every day. And you feel that there's some sort of reason for their actions doing this. Any other things that you've got problems with? Following me down, follow me down the street people following me when I'm going to shop. You know, it's happening more and more. And more and more. I mean, after, you know, I've tried to explain to my friends about it, they get really agitated, they think, you know, they think I'm off my rocker, but they don't see it. You know, they're not living with every day. You know. So your friends worried as well. Yeah, yeah. He won't worry, too. I mean, I don't. I don't think they're on it. I don't think but they know a lot about what's been going on and maybe the police have been talking to them or something. Or maybe my neighbor has been talking to them. I don't know. Again, you know, you'd have to ask them. But you know, it's hard. It's hard to know, it's hard to know who to Talk to you because they all did. You know, so they're all involved. So they started happening a few months ago. Has it had any other effects on your life? Well, yeah,  such as can't really go out. Well, I can, but I know what's gonna happen if I do.

Please, open your mouth and stick your tongue. All right, Mr. Smith, my main concerns here for scoring are that you've increased your weight at a pace that's a little faster than What normally happens and with it waves, intended notice that because we sleep at night, the extra weights they put on, can actually help and can push your tongue backwards and sort of covering one pipe and then it creates snoring that you've been having. So, if you could imagine you're laying down like this. Okay? And here's your nose and this is where the airflow comes in, to windpipe, okay, here's your mouth, and your tongue just sits like that. Now, sometimes what can happen is that the time So down here in this area that can actually stop the airflow here. So what happens during this reaction to try and get oxygen in? Okay? For this, I would like to run a couple tests to do bottom of it. I will be advising you to go for a sleep study. And I can measure how well you're sleeping and delineates what's happening, what's causing the snoring. Your heart sounds sound good. And because I think it's, it's possible that you may have to also have a heart condition that's related to it. I would like to get an ECG. Why do you get heart condition? Why do you get heart condition and snoring and sleep apnea? I think they are related Oh, and then regarding the increase in weight, I can advise you to eat a low fat low cholesterol diet. I'd like you to increase your exercise to five times a week for about 30 minutes and I would like to order some bloodwork because you haven't had your physical in a while no include your blood sugar, your cholesterol, and electrolytes and such. Okay. Do you have any other questions for me? Take medications that normally driving, snoring and driving go hand in hand mo with time. If you're snoring and you have sleep apnea, you are not. You do not advise properly patient slowly or caution you that you feel sleepy while driving car. Very, very important, right? You can have an accident, right? What are the symptoms of sleep apnea? Is snoring awful tired, trouble sleeping at night risk factors are decreased oxygenation because of the breathing.

23,"Summarize: So now as you kind of take a emotional inventory of your stress and worry and anxiety and you scale it, how would you put yourself now? I think is probably closer to three now feeling more hopeful and kind of not feeling I guess maybe feeling like it's a little bit less of a big deal than I felt like when I came in so some of the some of the intimidation of the concerns have been relaxed a bit as backed off, it comes and goes, it's still there. Three is still suffering, but not as much as before. And not nearly as much as the peak.  Yeah, yeah. Do you think going forward, you can apply this self talk in the morning, when that automatic clock comes up, like we make that kind of plan. Yeah, I think that'll be good because then also in the morning, I'll remember it's the morning and having these thoughts I need to do this. There are a lot of places we're going to go. As we talk about CBT and how it relates to what you're going through. I don't want to put too much on you at one time. So I'm kind of deliberately not going to a long explanation, the theory and not assigned A lot of homework, the homework is an important part of it. Okay? And one that I feel is in the best interest of clients to really take seriously and make a best effort to do. Okay. So, I'd like that to be one of the, you know, if you're okay with it, that'd be one homework steps, and the other one. So just just be two things for this week. So that self talk in the morning, and the other one was, is really just starting to cultivate an awareness in the day of when you're having these automatic thoughts. So these automatic thoughts proceed. feelings, and behaviors that you don't like, like feeling worried. So they're a little hard to pick up at first, because you're already having the feeling before you even think, to think about the thought, if that makes sense. And there's a few steps But you're already having the feeling of worry. And now I'm asking you to stop in that moment and try to recover the thought that led to that. Yeah. So that's not an easy request, satisfied to starting out with just try to bring up an awareness of that. If you can, I think super helpful, the best way is to write it down, if it's safe to do so. And if you can't, okay. So perhaps sometime today, you find yourself extra worried. And then you think back to what was going through your mind. And you find it was worrying about the welfare of the family, like a thought like, oh, they're not doing so well. Just don't judge the thought. Just write down. I was thinking to the family that might not be doing so well. Okay. What should I do with it? Should I like write it on a sticky note and get rid of it? Should I keep it in a journal or? Good question. I would say keep in touch. journal, okay, and bring it in. To the extent you're comfortable talking about, we can go over. Okay. And we'll try to together develop self talk to address that. Okay. So we're going to build, we're going to build an inventory of adaptive responses. Okay. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about or concerns about today in common we talked about? No, I mean, I think it was really helpful. I just had to remember to, you know, kind of combat things in the morning and then as the day goes by, if I notice any other thoughts, just write it down and everything. I can do that. I think that would be a great start. And we'll set up a time for down here for another point for next week. We'll get that all situated. But I want to Close just by letting you know, kind of my impressions from on this first session. Okay. I know you have worries, and I am working on understanding them with the family and the decision you made and I can certainly appreciate it's it's a struggle for you. At the same time I see somebody very conscientious. No, you're, you're very concerned about the work you do. You're concerned about the people you're act with. compassionate, empathetic. I see a lot of strength in terms of your ability to understand these concepts I'm talking about and apply them in your life. So I want you to take away from this I hope you take away from this, that you should be helpful. I feel like you have a lot of positive characteristics and strengths that you Bring to overcome the struggle, and I think you'll be stronger as a result of working to overcome. Does that resonate with you? How do you think of yourself? Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I've worked a lot to help other people. So I think I probably do have the ability to help myself as well. And I also believe that, you know, if I do the work, then in the future, when stuff makes me stressed out, I might be a little better at handling it. Yeah, so I hope that you'll be able to overcome what's going on now. But also build a skill set that you can use to overcome new challenges, because you'll face new ones. And I want you to be the most prepared you can be I feel like even though you have these worries and anxieties, I want I'd like you to remember you have a lot of strengths. I feel like you can do pretty well with this. So we'll stop there. If You're good and we'll set you up for appointments next week. Okay. Thank you.

I didn't want to be in how do I put this little Like, I want it to be in control. And I wanted to make sure that all my friends were Okay, so I didn't let myself drink too much. There's really no such thing as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're under age is drinking too much. You know, like, think about it. Think about all the things that can happen to you. Yeah, I understand exactly what you're saying. And how much are you drinking? I don't think I'm drinking that much. I mean, it's, it's mainly for social gatherings. Like it's nothing that I do, like by myself or whatever. It's just the it's like, every weekend ? every other weekend, I would say Tommy, I'm just so concerned, you know, can't you think of anything better to do? I guess I can, I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I do get where you're coming from. Yeah, is are your friends the problem? Like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with? Yeah, I guess I haven't really put it on myself, I guess it's really been forced on their account. And I've just been following in their footsteps just to just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun. And I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can. Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here. Yeah, I, I do see that. Maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I It does make a lot of sense. And I, I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking. I think youreally need to quit. Yeah, I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I, I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely. I don't I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life. I think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, I wish you would quit. If all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. That's really important.  Yeah, I, I just I don't see the problem in it right now. And maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic event experience. But, umm do you want to wait for that to happen? Do you want to wait for a dramatic experience? You're right. I don't want I don't want to be too far gone. Before it's too late. Like I I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I I guess I've never really had any, any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much are affected anybody close to me that much. So I guess it's something that I feel like I'm in control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.  All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control  here and stop drinking. Yeah, I think that that would be a good step forward into and life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol. Okay. Sounds good.",The therapist expresses concern over patient's underage drinking at social gatherings. The patient says they have drinking under control and they drink every other weekend.

25,"Summarize: So, Chris, I wanted to talk to, you know, you're one of our star athletes and really value you as a team player. As athletic director, one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend, I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.  Okay. Oh, actually could I can find something new. That doesn't bother me lately. Well, prior to that party, like as you know, I'm an honor student and my parents like they keep me very, like, kick kept down out of the lake Salt Lake social life, and I own About a month ago, my friends invited me to a party and they use the fact that all I'm always doing my homework and always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on.  Hmm umm Well, that party, I managed to convince my parents I would spend the night at my friend's house.  Ahmm Hmm Alright. So I, that's when I started drinking was a unique experience, as you could say, I guess you can say, and I don't know, It was fun, at least in that moment. So I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my I begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing. She asked me to like to promise her Oh, no alcohol, no drugs, man, I'll pick you up by 12. Our surprise is told us basically when the party starts, but I saw that whatever I saw, I thought to myself that I'll, I'll come out figure it out to delay her coming to me and later.  Uhh hmm So later, so she promised that she dropped me off. I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So we go out Have fun like I've, I've been having, and I was drinking. And then it's time, the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon as I couldn't delay her for hanging out, and as soon as she picked me up and I stepped in the car, she said, You drank vodka. And I'm like, I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor, and I feel terrible. Because I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did. So here you are. You're an honor student, your star athlete, you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years. And maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first, but now you're already noticing some consequence right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork. Ahhh hmmm. Really, I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere, especially on the way weekends where instead of instead of studying, I'm caught up with my friends trying to find where we can get alcohol based on their age and, and stuff like that.  It has really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?  I don't know it. It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not well, not when I'm doing sports, but like, like a social environment, I tend to keep to myself. Because I'm very self conscious, I would say and when I drink, I feel like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. And it's just. So, it helps you kind of  loosen up feel more relaxed.  Exactly. Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though. Mom got mad at you. You're having decreased focus, you're kind of not doing so well in school, maybe any other things ? Just different group friends of group girlfriends, like the different people that I'm hanging out. Not with because certain people are associated with that type of scene. So that that's also changed. So your your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now a little bit because not all of them are into that. So like, I'm in one group of friends and I will talk to another person within another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party. hmm hmm.  So since then, I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them. But I could also see that on just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before, as they are there for me. Yeah.  Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying and it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?  Oh, I should I should stop. I mean, like, I'm not, not unrealistic.  Yeah I understand that. situations like this will happen. It's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before. If I'm puking, all I remember is a toilet.  Umm That's, that's not worth it either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow as little or, like as it may seem to the other people like to me that it's a big thing. Your mom is really important to you ?  of course,  how confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or even cut down or quit? I'm pretty confident especially on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all and 10 is completely what number ? probably like an eight or nine I'm I can't be in time because nothing's attend my field. There's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven? Because I don't know I feel determined to to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I betrayed my mother. I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting. Umm hmm It's not a pleasant experience. It's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like, even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens. Like all the fun that I have, then prior to that, just it's not worth it's not worth drinking. Right? What do you think's a realistic goal for you then? To make sure I have my studies? Well, first, try to get back my trust with my mother. Okay Then just focus on my studies. Then if I have time for leisure time, like I'll go party with my friends and just be as a party with them doesn't mean I have to drink and I do. One cup is not gonna do anything to my life either. But I'd prefer not to do that I prefer just make sure your goals to not drink at all, or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very moment.  Exactly. Just so I take part with the social convention, but it's not. Hey, guys. It's about doing the Yeah. Chris, I really appreciate you talking with me about this. I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is. And, you know, like I said, I really care about you, as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you. So I'm glad we were able to talk about this, it really seems like you have a good plan going forward. You know, really striving for not drinking alcohol at all. And if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol, making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum. Sounds like something that'll work for you. And thank you for listening and listening to me. Yeah, it's my pleasure. It's part of my job and part I like best so we better hurry up and get changed for practice.","The patient is a star athelete and the therapist is counseling about their alcohol habits.

26,"Summarize:  All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school and as as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule and I've been hearing some chatter from some other kids about party this weekend, and from what I hear while you were there, and you know, I can't confirm or deny anything. So I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences. But I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.  All right, actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as you know, I'm an honor student, I usually am studying over the weekend, my parents told me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I when I got there, like, I'm not used to this like party environment, where everything that you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else is doing. So I wouldn't be I wouldn't be ostracized.  Oh, yeah, I get it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. You know, I was in high school one, too. You know, I drink too. I get it. There's not a ton to do in this town and kids drink but, you know, promise we have these rules and you're on a team, you have to stick by the rules. I know that. It's bad for me. It's bad for my body is bad for for, for for being on the team for being an athlete. it hinders my performance. Just I don't know, I feel that my friends pressured me. I don't know if I should, like, go with different friend groups. Maybe I don't know. Yeah, Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure. I don't know. Like, being in a sports team. You feel very, you have to, like, be unified with the group. Yeah, well, you're one of the leaders. Right and as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be expected To lead not only in the sports but also in social environments. And if that's social, so social custom in our society, so maybe you can start leading as a non drinker then I could, but that could also backfire on me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for being having the stick up my blood. You know, you're a star player who's gonna pick on you. I mean, it's just one. I'm just one person. All right.  Well, supermom. Yeah. So the issue again, is, I can't be hearing reports about your drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. So, you know, like I said, I get it. You know, I understand I know what it's like I get that you want to have fun, your teenage years. I get that. But you know, you are start player, we want to keep you on the team. You know, we got to figure out a way to get through this. Okay. Well, I'll dedicate the time not to party and like, no, not not not party, but you get involved with alcohol to that extent. And, like have it publicized on the internet.  What do you mean? Like on Facebook, all the pictures that you saw on the internet? Like, I will avoid situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time put on the internet so others can see. All right, yeah, I mean, we got to have a deal here if you're gonna be on the team, okay. I'll stop. Alright, you promise? I promise. All right, Jake. All right.

What kind of changes ? You know, just, you know, uh, you know, I lost my job. So, things are kinda you know, dominal effects from that. So, so there's been consequences from those in your job.

Yeah, I mean, not a lot more I mean, I guess I have more free time now so cuz now you don't have a job hmmm what affects you're experiencing because of the increased drinking?

When you're drinking does it still feel good? Nothing really feels good. Just gets back to normal.  Yeah, pretty much When was the last time you drank ? this morning How much? A lot, I don't know. You don't recall. No Is that is that typical? I mean, I don't recall you taking on the same day we've had sessions before. I mean, at a certain point, it's like, you know, difficult to wake up and not have a drink. Like to get through the day. So yeah, I mean, I just drink as much as it takes for me to function and I don't really know how much that is. Like, I don't sit there and count it like These are my three shots for the morning. I don't I don't know. Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then. You know, and just to function, so I don't know how much I don't know what your fuel is those towards like you're drinking more. Yeah. What would you say your attitude toward increased drinking is right now ? I'm pretty indifferent. Like I said, I mean, I just don't. I don't. At this point. It's like what does it matter like everything else has, I dont know So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other. I guess I just don't know why I should keep suffering like making myself suffer. So the drinking tastes was suffering. No, the feeling bad about the drinking makes me suffer. feeling bad about the drinking ? Yeah, I mean, yes, the drinking takes away the suffering but that's not what I meant. So feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems. That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying. How would you like to feel bad ? I would like to not, I would like to be happy. I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life. But at this point, I'd rather just I don't know, like, why should I keep feeling guilty about it? What is the point? Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it. So you no longer understand the point of life ? Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this? If it's not getting better and things are getting so bad that even if I was sober, I wouldn't be able to handle it. So, what do you see as your options right now? I don't know You tell me about some things you've been doing recently, like in the last three or four days. sitting at home drinking  hmm, that's about it. Not drinking anything else going liquor store that's about it. I mean, seriously, it's just funny like, I don't even there is nothing Now I know you're working on a few things like you're working on find another job. You've been doing that. No, not really. I mean, I'm going to lose my house so I'm just biding my time until that happens. I don't really know. Like what Yeah, I'm no I'm not looking for a job now So you have stopped looking for a job. hmmm And when are you losing your house? I don't know. It's it's hard to tell, you know, with the banks and everything, but it seems like it will be soon. What's your plan for when that happens? I don't have one. You don't have one ? No, no. before  we've talked and I've been seeing you while you're always pretty careful about planning things out. I've just decided I'm not gonna worry about it anymore. I can't I just can't do it anymore. can't worry anymore ? Yeah. my life is just full of worrying. I mean there's nothing to do except to worry about all of it, you know, my job, my drinking my house. So what do you see as your alternative to all this worrying? There is no alternative. So what do you do? I don't know. You don't know ? Yeah I've sensed this time, you're much more negativistic as compared you before. Do you recognize that has been the case?  Yes. Yes. Like, markedly so. Yeah. Like, I feel like things have taken a turn. Can you tell me about that turn? I don't know. I just feel like you know, I'm losing my house. I lost my job. I don't really have anything that needs to be done in order. Got in done order for what? like if I died, if you die if you die Nothing would have to be taken care of. I mean, like, I mean, they probably have a funeral but you know, right house is gone, my job is gone. My drinking will be gone. Would your family miss you? I don't really care. Even still, you think they would miss you? Maybe I mean, in their own way. They probably would have wished that they would have done different things differently. Yeah, but that's not my responsibility. What's your responsibility right now? Nothing. Nothing. I mean, So no one would correct me if I'm wrong. No one would care if you die. I mean, they probably care a little bit. Do I care if they care? No. So you care a little, but you're not concerned with that. And you have this sense that you have nothing left to lose because you've lost a job. And now soon, your house you have anything else that you care about? Any goals ? I used to how about now ? No. What happened to your goals? I drank them. I lost my job. I lost my house. But you know, I was thinking maybe I could find myself a new job but at this point I'm just so far gone like my life is so ruined I don't know how you could expect me to come back from this I don't know how you can expect me to live a life how to pick this up and make something of it like how to redeem yourself. Mm hmm you can't see what to do that now. No. I mean come on. Cuz cuz all things that happened to overwhelmed you. I don't know. I mean, happened to me did to myself. It's just at this point. It's like I've lost so much have what I worked for. And I don't have one scrap of dignity or anything at all. I don't have anything. You don't have anything you don't have any worth. worthless. That's how you're feeling ? Yeah, alone. worthless. Yeah, like nothing. There's nothing redeemable. There's nothing I can build upon. and have you been thinking about ending your life? Are you hesitant to tell me that ? Yes why is that ? I guess a lot of reasons. I know that we have worked together and I don't want you to feel like you failed. I really don't want you to try to do anything because I feel like nothing that you have tried has worked. You know, I'm a hopeless case.  hmmm And I feel like at this point, it shouldn't even be your responsibility to try because it's not fair to you anymore. And I don't know. I just Oh,  you're planning on ending your life ? ideal plan in place ? Yeah. Can you tell me about the plan? I don't really want to talk about it. But you have a plan. You don't want me to interfere in your plan? No, no, obviously not. But you're aware that I'm going to try to interfere with your plan. I get I guess so. You mentioned earlier that you just I mean, it sounds like you're saying is you've hit rock bottom and rock bottom can't be tolerated. And your family would care if they lost you, but you're indifferent to that. Right? I would care if you die. All right, I'm gonna do everything I can to prevent that. It's hard to see when you have thoughts or worthlessness. It's hard to see stress. But I see somebody with strengths. I see a young  lady that over the last few months has told me all kinds of strengths, all kinds of situations where you've been resilient.You recall those conversations ? I guess. But that's not in the forefront of your mind right now. You're strange, but they're still there. Do you have an intent to commit suicide? Yes And you don't want me to stop here? Yeah I'm going to stop you. Right? I want to, I'm obligated to. And it's really the best thing to be done is to prevent it. I know you feel this way now, and I know I can't fully understand that. But I'm fairly sure that you won't feel this way. A week or two from now. Right feelings of worthlessness, feelings of hitting rock bottom, they cycle just like all feelings. Right? You've had ups and downs before. Remember ? Yes I see some of the long and productive life. suicides not it's not the answer. I know it seems like the only option right now. I get that. But there's still some other options. Does that make sense? Yeah I know you probably don't wanna hear about other options. I think what we should do today is get you over as an impatient Alright? And go pi keep you for 5-10 days and kind of work on getting your mood stable. My guess is when you come out, you'll feel differently on this subject. You'll feel a little better. Maybe feel a little better place we can continue. And we will. I'll see you will schedule associate that on the day or the day after you come out. Right. Preferably on the same day. Does that make sense to you? I mean, I guess. Are you disappointed? I'm trying to save your life. Yeah. Do you understand why I'm doing it. Yeah. All right. So I'm gonna walk you over 20 other counselors. I gotta make some phone calls. We'll get you over there. Okay. All right.

Or do you suspect in your family? I don't know. I mean, I don't know.  Okay. Can you tell me about any disorders you've been diagnosed with? Um, well, right now, I think that I've been diagnosed with depression. And in the past, I've had some problems with anxiety. But How about now? How about now I'm having problems with anxiety ? Hmm Umm not as bad as in the past. How is depression? Yeah,  right now ? Yeah. And how bad? pretty bad. Yeah. On a scale of one to 10 with 10 being the worst it's ever been. How  depressed you're now ? Probably Like an eight or nine, Eight or Nine that's depressed ? Yeah. How about anxiety at the same scale? Probably like a four or five. You're fine. So not quite as bad as its been ? No, not as bad as it's been, but it's getting up there. Yeah, it's getting worse lately. Yeah, I think yeah, it's been worse lately. Yeah. So if you'r think back, say a couple days ago. How bad was the anxiety and depression? anxiety probably like a three or four. Depression about an eight or nine still same. same intensity? Yeah, yeah. Alright, Do you have any medical illnesses? Um, no. Do you live alone? Yeah you do ? Yeah How often you see your relatives? probably see my relatives like every, like, maybe once a month, maybe once a month, how about friends ? friends, it depends. Not as much lately, I used to be better friends with my coworkers and I lost my job. So I haven't seen them as much. And so probably maybe like once a week, maybe once a week depends on the week. How long ago you lost your job? Umm about two months ago, two months ago,  Hmm I'm sorry to hear that happens to you. how would you characterize the strength of your social network? Like, is it as strong as you want it to be? No, sometimes I feel pretty alone. Yeah, I feel like you know, nobody really wants me around. Nobody really needs me. So yeah. I feel pretty alone a lot of time. Sometimes even when I'm with other people, so you're with people when you still feel isolated. Yeah. When you are with people when you're not feeling isolated, how would you characterize the quality of the relationships you have? Let's start with your family. How good do you think those relationships are? I mean, they're okay. Like not really that great. But everybody has like, trouble with their family. I guess so. I don't know. You think its more or less normal? Yeah, yeah. How is it with your friends? It's okay. You know, I guess I'm always like, second guessing everything. Like, do they really like me? Do they really want to spend time with me? I know I'm bothering them. That kind of thing. But I mean, it's not for the most part. I mean, I think they care about me. It's a pretty, you know, we have a good time. I think When we're together for the most part but most part positive ? yeah Do you have any conflict or crisis going on right now? You mentioned the loss of your job. Yeah, I'm, I'm gonna be evicted from my house or you know, my apartment because I can't pay my bills because I lost my job so I really don't know what I'm going to do or where I'm going to go. I just don't know what to do. I'm feeling really lost and like helpless and like everything's just pointless. I'm sorry to hear that. When are you going to be evicted? Um, well, I'm not quite sure. Um, it sounds like it's going to be at the end of the month. So then month are going to be evicted from the is it  house or  apartment ? Its an apartment when did you find this out? Um, well, you know, before I lost my job, I had some trouble paying the rent as it was. So, um, you know, the last time I missed my rent was probably like, a month and a half ago, my landlord kind of told me that I couldn't live there anymore, but I didn't know, you know, how much stock to put in Then and Now, at the beginning of the month, he said, you know, you have to, you're gonna have to get out of here, you're gonna be evicted. We're gonna change the locks. And so it's all fairly recent. Yeah. I guess that's why having more anxiety than before because like, it feels really out of control, and I don't know what is going to happen like when he's going to do it, you know, for sure and how you know what I'm going to do. So there's a lot of uncertainty around what's going to happen and what's going to happen to you? Exactly hmmm...have you in the past thought about suicide? Yeah, yeah, definitely. Can you tell me about how many times or about how often ? Umm probably like, every time I get depressed like this, I, I, you know, have those thoughts. So I don't know. I mean, how often? That's that's a really hard question. All right. Have you ever attempted to commit suicide? Yeah, one time, probably like four years ago. What did you do? I cut my wrists, but it wasn't, you know, nothing really happened. Like I just put a I just wrapped him up. It wasn't really that bad You didn't need to go to hospital No Have you ever thought about committing suicide and we're about to attempt and stopped ? Yeah, yeah.  How many times does that happen? Umm maybe like three or four. It's hard to remember cuz sometimes is a long time ago but more recently like maybe once or twice at least. So once or twice in the recent past ? Yeah. Have you ever injured yourself intentionally? Yeah. Okay, can you tell me about that. Well, there was that time that I tried to commit suicide and then there have been times before that where I like, you know, kind of like tested the waters like, you know, just cut myself a little bit to see what it would be like and that kind of thing. was the last time  You have done that ? Um, it would be the last time I tried to commit suicide like that with time I was telling you about that really freaked me out. So I don't think I would try that again. so you don't think you'd try that again. No  Not like cutting myself up. Okay. Have you ever been abused, physically, sexually, emotionally?  I don't know. So if you get evicted, you're worried you'd have to live with your mother.  Yeah. And you guys had a rough time in the past. Yeah. You don't want to repeat that. No, I don't wanna live like that  What is your attitude towards suicide? What are your feelings about suicide as a concept in general? I don't know. I mean, I guess it's really sad like, nobody wants that. You know, whenever you hear somebody committed suicide, everybody's really sad about it, but sometimes it just feels like what else is there? You know, like, I don't know how I can go on like this, like things just keep getting worse and worse. And I don't know what to do. So I mean, I'm sure. Like, it's not a great thing, but at the same time, I don't know. You disapprove it, But you're considering it because you're running out of options. Yeah Have you ever been impulsive in the past? Um, I don't know. Like, I guess not really. Because there have been times when I've like thought about committing suicide and getting really close and still haven't done it. You know, Do you have other areas other than suicide. Generally impulsive I don't think so. Ever violent or aggressive? Not really, no, no. Have you ever experienced a couple loose nations, which should be like hearing things other people can't hear seeing things that people can't see.  I don't think so. I You don't think so. No, I mean, it's hard to tell what other people can't hear when no one's around to tell you whether they can hear it or not. But I don't think that I have to be fairly certain, you know that? Yeah. Can you tell me about any alcohol or drug use? Sometimes I drink, you know, alone when I'm in my house, because like I said, I don't see a lot of other people. I don't really do any drugs. When's the last time you had a drink? Last night How much did you had ? Probably like a bottle of wine. A bottle of wine. Is that typical for you? Yeah, it is.  How often would you say you drink a bottle of wine ? maybe like three or four times a week, three or four times a week  ? Yeah So I want to ask you about these suicidal thoughts that you're having now. How frequently Are you having these thoughts? Like really often coming all the time or not? Yeah, yeah.  how intense would you say the thoughts are ? fairly intense, Like it's scary the thought of it, you know, but at the same time, like, I'm having them so much it's, I don't know. It's frightening for you. Yeah. Do you have a plan laid out if you're trying to commit suicide? I guess I would just drink a bottle of wine like I usually do and then maybe take some pills. What kind of pills ? um, there's like ibuprofen in my medicine cabinet. That's like the only thing I have in there other than vitamin. So I guess I just take that. I don't know how many. 4 I guess I dont know. So you would drink a bottle of wine and take a lot of ibuprofen ? Hmm mmm Do you have an intent to commit suicide? You're gonna you're gonna fall through ? I don't know like sometimes I think about it I get really close to doing it, but I you know, I haven't like taken any pill so I guess yeah, like I think about it a lot and I've gotten close to doing it so yeah, I guess Yeah, I guess so  Do you feel like you have an intent ? Yeah Can you tell me about some of the reasons for staying alive for not committing suicide? Well, I don't really want to die. Um, I guess my friend family would be really upset and I probably my friends, too. I don't know. Do you have any religious or cultural values surrounding suicide? Not really You have an pets at home I have a cat. Yeah. What would happen to your cat? I give her to my sister shorty has a couple cats. So, you know, I've already asked her, you know, if anything were to happen to me, you know, just in general, if she would take the cat, you know, when did you ask for that? Kind of like, two months ago, so not related to what's going on now? No, I guess not. I mean, I don't know. Like I just asked her in general like if anything happened to me. So do you have any other reasons for living? I don't know. I mean, I lost my job. I I live alone. I don't know, like, I'm gonna have to, like move out and I don't even know where I'm going to go. That's scary for you. And anxiety is provoking? Yes. What did you do when you worked? I just You mean like what kind of job did I do ? Yes I worked at a gas station. Did you like the work? I liked it. You know we had some regular customers and kind of get to know them its a little. I don't know. You just you know that my coworkers are nice. And you know, we have not like great benefits, but there was some stuff you know, you could get like couple vacation days and stuff. So do you ever look forward to get another job? I just don't see how I would. What is that ? I mean, I lost this job. So why would I be good enough to get another job? Because you lose a strike? I went to work drunk. Can you tell me about some of your strengths? What are some of your positive qualities? ....can't think of any ? I don't know What would ? What was your family say your strengths were ? screaming and yelling, right? I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. It's hard for you to think positively right now is it? Yes Alright Sharon, here's, we're gonna do, I'm gonna appreciate you allow me to complete this assessment.

30,"Summarize: Nice to see you again, Tom. How are you today?  I'm okay. So I understand that since I was seeing you that while ago that you were in hospital again. Yeah. So can you tell me a bit more about what happened before that ? was a few months ago now. Yeah, I've done quite well, for a number of years. So kept itunder control, really, but uh yeah. I mean, I've not I've not seen you since your gap years wasn't it? yeah, so that was four years ago. So yeah, it was quite disappointing to, to go through all again. But it's sort of started at the, towards the end of university. So staying low, and close on course, for first I know she's coming up to my final exams, and a lot of us as a few exams. And so I just started working really hard. I felt like right now is the real time to put the effort in and to put the work in. So I started to step a bit later and take on a bit more work. So my stress levels sort of start to increase over a while. I was drinking a lot more coffee took few caffeine tablets and energy drinks. A few people were because some of the environment at the time was a lot of people were pushing themselves that they wouldn't normally do and some people were taking Ritalin. Okay. Yeah. did you take any Ritalin? Yeah. Because it was just like it was that was necessary at the time. And how did that affect you? Well, I it's sort of increased my confidence at the time. everything that was going on, I was becoming a lot more productive and a lot more competent a lot, was working harder, my brain was working faster. And so I mmmmm momentum was building up and up throughout the period. Yeah, and so I was I was relishing it I was doing a lot work and so did that mean to you then to be at that time it sounds like you put quite a lot of pressure on yourself you've been doing really well at uni and and you know, this was it This was the time. What did it mean to be feeling like that kind of more awake and more energized maybe? Yeah, well, for me it was. It was my sort of time. So I spent I spent three years I thought  I was in control I was doing well. I didn't wasn't really part of my life at the time. I didn't really talk to any of my friends about it. But then I yeah, I started to just sort of grow into it. And I took the opportunity to Yeah, enjoy this time and it's so it didn't really reach its peak until after my exams I was still. I was still functioning throughout my exams, and I have since found out that I didn't get the results that I wanted to. and what you might think that was? Well, I thought that I was working harder than ever, but it was misjudged, I think and so I, I didn't perform to the best of my ability in when it came to the to the exams, and so I didn't achieve. I didn't achieve a first time and I only got to one. what else was happening for you around that time? I mean, you talked about the pressure of your exams and staying up for them was anything else going on? And the same time well, so to the end of the end of university, and that was the time where all as soon as that period stopped of work then I was sort of let off the leash a bit. And yeah, I just thought to grow even further. So I mentioned I was I was taking Ritalin to block coffee and as soon as our exams had stopped, I just substance abuse of took a bit more of a hold. And yeah, I just sort of grew into this person who I thought was him was the guy that everyone wanted to be around and to see and so I made sure that I was just everywhere that could be seen I was. This is like there they got after you finish the exams but before the results are out, yeah. So we will just scan out a lot, but if not every night  he said that you were taking Ritalin and drinking a lot of coffee. Yeah and then using other drugs as well. Yeah. So developed into cocaine. A lot. Okay. And the Ameri and car. How's that affect you? I honestly was on cloud nine at the time. And yeah, I was just always the person ever wanted. Everyone wanted to know. In my head. I was like, I put myself at the center of the universe and I even I convinced a friend of mine who develops apps that we should if I had an idea to develop an app about when you go into a alcohol shop that it all the way up put out what's the most cost effective way to get wasted?  Right. So yeah, I mean, I, at the time I was spending a lot of money, a lot of my parents savings, I got a credit card, which I didn't tell them about. And so in this sort of role as the man as the man about town I was spent a lot on Yeah, I'll hold drugs close invested in this technology and I was so it sounds like it began with kind of the exam pressure and putting more pressure on yourself to stay up using kind of stimulants keep yourself awake. And then you started to feel like you were more and more the man you were you were kind of popular you were successful. How did you respond to and cope with those symptoms? What did you do once those are kind of begun? Well, having not had to deal with my illness throughout University and for it not being a part of that world, I I didn't confront those symptoms in a in a way that's gonna have long term stability. And as well, it began with doing the work that I needed to do. That's just, that's just what I needed to do in order to achieve my goals and to achieve what I want to. And then it just, I just let it take hold. And I it was all part of it wasn't it wasn't Yeah, it wasn't the illness It was me it was just I was in, I was the master of this whole situation and I was everything that was happening was down to my own doing. So it sounds is on the one hand, you didn't confront it, you kind of just let it roll. And on the other hand, you said that you kind of took it as evidence that you were very energetic, you were powerful. This was all kind of explained about who you were. And I guess how did that affect you looking at things in that way?  It just it was my time. It all been leading to like, this was the moment where I would sort of like, become the person that I want it to be. all the hard work, all everything while the work that my parents had done for me and all the work that I had been doing. It was now crystallizing for you on the brink of something, yeah, mess from the sounds of it.  And, again, going back to that kind of beginnings Ah, where you started to stay up late and use stimulants. I mean, how much sleep were you getting at the beginning? They saw it gradually diminished. I think it began at six, five. And was ended up about three and two. and what kind of things did you notice? Did you notice any changes from having less and less sleep in your body maybe the way you were thinking. Think the harder I was working, the faster my brain then will work and how much the harder I work, the more I would do. So it was it wasn't. It was just a Yeah, the momentum was building more than anything. My thoughts were firing and my goals was stronger in my Yeah, my determination was and how did you feel in your body? Did you notice any changes physically? No, I couldn't recall the time maybe I was trying to get my way I was avoiding avoiding confronting any negative effects but nothing powerful comes on.  Okay. I wants you to kind of things were a bit further along after your exams. He said you're going out a lot you convinced your friend to do this app. Was there anything else that you did that maybe you wouldn't normally do that you think might have been assigned to you that your meat was much higher than you'd like it to be? There was I hide a lot of savings. That my my parents had built up for me, which I probabiliy don't really exist anymore either through the money invested, and through drugs, clothes. I had a girlfriend at the time but because it was because I was the main character, and in a sense, it always was only the only person that matters and so sort of those around me especially, still didn't really have as much importance. So on nights out, I wouldn't. She just wouldn't be in my mind and so that would be Other women.  Okay,  so how do you feel about that now looking back on it ? I think it's, it's those moments where it's not just me. It's those those closest to you and those around you that have to suffer the more than anyone else that brings a lot of the shame","The patient had final exams approaching and they had to put more efforts. This increased their stress levels and they started taking Ritalin. The patient felt increased confidence, worked a lot harder and were a lot productive but they did not secure the grades they wished to. The patient was in control of themselves for three years. The patient got too involved with substance abuse like cocaine after finishing exams and before results. The patient has been using their parent's savings and got a credit card too to spend on drugs. The patient feels at the brink of succeeding from their hard work and they seem to have fallen trap to the stimulants. The patient had just been getting two to three hours of sleep. The patient has also not given importance to their girlfriend. The patient feels they were not themselves, and people closest to them have been most affected.

31,"Summarize: Okay, so I noticed on your diary card that you have that you did cut. Yep. Okay, so let's talk about that a little bit. When what day did that happen on?  Tuesday Tuesday? Okay, so where were you on Tuesday when you first had the thought that you wanted to cut? Where I usually always am at school. I was on my Walker. That's stupid girl. What was going on at your locker? Melanie was talking about Tim my Tim. My boyfriend and I know it was it was my Tim she was talking about I just wanted to punch her so bad. Okay, so you were sending out your locker and you heard somebody say something about Tim that you didn't want to hear.  Yeah, she was talking about him. And he had he didn't text me the night before. So who knows what's going on?  What were you feeling right then? so angry. so angry on a scale of one to 10  how angry would you say you were ? like a nine pretty angry then? Yeah. What did you do right then? You ride your locker. What's the next thing you did after you heard it? The next thing I did, I slammed my locker. And I walked down to the gym but what I wanted to do was push her adn punch her. So I know that the gym is usually to the place where you cut, because you said you can go behind the bleachers people don't usually see you there. Yeah. Okay, so we're between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym. Where did you decide to cut? Because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody. There must have been a point where you decided I'm going to cut. I think it was right after I slammed my locker and thought I can't punch her. I'm going to get in trouble. I'm going to go cut. Okay, so that was when you decided to cut. You went down to the gym.  Mm hmm. And what happened when you got there? Well, nobody was there because gym classes are in the morning so I knew that nobody was going to come in the gym. So I went behind the bleachers. What did you use to cut ? the pencil that I have always used the same pencil as usual? Yeah the the metal tip. Yeah. Okay, that was a pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of. Yeah, I know. It's just it's it's my favorite pencil. I, I use it for school. And I just it's my favorite pencil.  Okay, so you still have the pencil you got under the bleachers. You say you were feeling angry still. Are you still on the scale of one to 10 where were you when you got under the bleachers. I was still like was still pretty high maybe like an eight and a half though because I I knew I knew I was gonna cut Okay,  so it like came down a little bit what were you thinking at that point? Well I thought a couple things I thought I'm glad I kept this pencil and that I'm just so pissed that I just want to cut so badly. So you have your pencil Where did you cut ? on my leg. How many times ? three How deep did you cut where it was a deep enough that you needed a band aid, Did you need more than a band aid? No, I mean, I guess I could have used a band aid but whatever. But it wasn't so deep that you needed something more? No. Okay. Right after you cut Where were you on the scale of one to 10 with your feeling with your anger? Like a three three, what were you thinking right afterwards? That felt good. I feel better. And I'm gonna have to talk to Michelle about this. Did that feeling last you for the rest of the day? The Feeling better? Yeah, for the most part. Yeah, it did Okay, so that's what happened right afterwards ?  Mm hmm. Later in the day, are we thinking about the cutting? Well, I kind of forgot about it.  Okay. But then I just started thinking about it again, right before bad, and just feeling really guilty that I cut. Because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you. And I just I mean, I, the night time I just, I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like, I mean, you know, it's usually a pretty hard time. I know night is a really difficult time for you is everything seems worse at night. Yeah. So you were thinking back at a back on it then and you were feeling guilty? Yeah. Sounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon. No. That always seems to happen. Sounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last? Yeah, I guess so. I knew you've also been working on doing less cutting. I've been doing pretty good you have you've been working really hard. I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings? Yeah, maybe. I mean, those guilty feelings really suck. Okay, so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut out your locker. what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim. Yeah, cuz she's stupid. Okay, it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day. You said he hadn't called. He hadn't been texting us. And that was on your mind? Yeah. That's right. So I'm wondering if that point, if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting. Okay that'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit. It's not going to bring it down all the way to a three, though. I'll tell you that much. It might not. But it'll bring it down a little bit. Maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more. All right maybe there'll be things will feel good about later. You won't have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back. All right. So the first thing is that pencil, it sounds like it's comforting to have it.  Yeah, it is. It also sounds like it's tempting, What do you think about that? I mean, Only if I am in the mood to cut it's tempting having that pencil is going to make it harder to try other things. When you've been talking about how you're really committed to not cutting any more or cutting less Yeah, I am. Sounds like that pencils standing in your way. Yeah, maybe. What do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time, choosing a different favorite pencil that maybe you can't cut with.  I mean, maybe only, only if it's can be like a really cool pencil That way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which won't tempt you. That'll make it easier to try the two things. Yeah. Okay, what do you think our first thing should be? What do you think you can try? You just heard somebody say something you don't want to hear you're feeling pretty angry. What can you do in that moment? Oh, what I do a lot at home when my mom's bothering me and saying stuff I don't want to hear I put my headphones on. Do you have your headphones with you at  school? Yeah, they they they actually they let me keep them on in school. Is that something you'd be willing to try next time? I think so. there's a there's a few songs that usually helped me so I think so. Okay, that sounds like a good one to try. So we have headphones, we need to come up with One more. What do you think you'd like to try? Well, I really like my teacher, Mrs. Xion. So she seems to always kind of be there when I need to talk. And her rooms kind of right down the hallway from my locker than the same hallway. So I guess I could talk to her.  That sounds like a good option. That's our goal is to keep pushing, cutting further down the list, and keep adding things that you're going to try first. And you're right that the first thing you try, it might not bring you all the way down to a two or three, but it might bring you down a little bit. And each thing you try might bring you down just a little bit more. So you have to be willing to try a few things. Can you do that? I can, but I really want like a cooler pencil though, like, like a cooler pencil, so I don't know, maybe, maybe we could go look for a pencil together. I think that's a good idea. Okay, I'd like that.  Okay. Thank you for answering all my questions on this. You did a great job with this chain and I know it wasn't easy. Yeah. You're welcome. Let's go look for a pencil.","The patient has been angry that another girl had been talking about their boyfriend Tim near their locker the other day. They were angry at a score of 9 out of 10. The patient decided to go to the gym behind the bleachers to cut themselves, by using their favorite pencil with metal head. They cut on their leg three times. The patient scored their anger 3 out of 10 after the cut. The patient felt guilty for cutting themselves. The therapist suggests to think of alternatives, and asks to buy a new favorite pencil and get rid of metal head pencil. They discuss another idea to put on headphones if they wish to avoid to hear things that make them angry. The patient suggested that they will talk to Mrs. Xion who seems to be kind. The therapist assures these ideas if tried will slowly help and accompanies the patient to buy a new pencil. ","on a scale of one to 10, how angry would you say you were then?

32,"Summarize: Elizabeth, how you doing today? Um All right. How things been going since the last time we met? it's about the same. I'm still feeling pretty down. I mean, I just feel really stuck and not happy and I just don't know why. Okay, so there's a few things going on there. You said you feeling stuck? Not happy. And some sound like a little confused as to what's going on what's causing it. You have any suspicions about what might be causing? I mean, I've been feeling like really isolated lately. You know, because I'm a stay at home mom. It's hard. There's not a lot of people. You know, right at my fingertips to spend my time with, you know, obviously my family but, um, so I guess, you know, I kind of I had some friends in the neighborhood, but like, our friendships just kind of fizzled out. And I ever since then it's just like, I don't really feel like doing much. I just kind of feel like what's the point and let my husband take care of a lot of stuff. You know, I used to, you know, shop for the groceries all the time and make sure the house is always stocked and make dinner every night and get the kids ready for school in the morning and I still do that stuff. But a lot of times, you know, I let it slide. Sometimes I won't make dinner or whatever. And when I do do it, I just feel like I'm forcing myself to do it. The passion is gone. And how long have you been? You say housewife, right? How long, you've been the housewife? For a long time, I have two boys. They're eight and 10 and I've been staying home since my first one was born. So 10 years and you know, it's it's been really rewarding for me I'm not really interested in going back to work or anything like that. Because I know people always say you're, you know, you're feeling unfulfilled, like you should go back to work, but it's not it. You know, I've felt happy with it for so long. I don't think that it's being home. I think it's some thing inside of me. something's changed. So for a long time, you were satisfied in housewife, you enjoyed that life or found satisfaction out of life. And somewhere along the line, something changed in you. And now you're not happy with it. So what it represents in terms of activities like caring for your children and shopping? No, that's what changed. Yeah, exactly. Well, I guess, you know, my youngest is eight. So he's only been in school for a couple of years. So I guess like, it's not super recent, but recently he, I finally have no children in the home. So it's more, it's more time to myself. And I kind of fill that gap a little bit with other things. Like I did Cub Scouts with the boys for a while. And like I said, I had some friends around the neighborhood so that kind of like, fill that time. But now that stuff, it's just not really happening anymore. So now I kind of feel like it's not it's not boredom, you know, it's not like I don't have enough to do. It's like, I don't want to do anything. But then at the same time, I feel frustrated because there's nothing to do. So you're, you're frustrated with your situation, maybe with yourself a little bit. Yeah, I think a lot more with myself because I know That I would feel better if I, you know, maybe found more friends or found something to do with my time, but I don't want to at the same time, so I'm frustrated with myself because I know I kind of know what would help but then I don't really have the like the volition to do it. You're not motivated? Yeah,I'm not motivated.  Have you received any feedback from other people about this meaning? Has anyone else noticed that you're down? Yeah, I mean, obviously, my husband has noticed because he has to get the boys ready in the morning. He's really supportive. I know he can tell that I'm not feeling the same. But you know, he works. And then he has to come home and pick up my slack. So he's getting frustrated, which I understand. And, you know, my mom has said to me that, you know, she thinks I'm not doing as much and so it kind of hurts. It feels like everybody's trying to tell me I'm lazy and then I'm not doing enough and it's always that like feeling, you know, like nobody really understands how much work that goes into being a mother, but then at the same time now that I'm doing less and less, I feel like they're all right. You know, I am lazy. I'm not doing anything they used the word lazy. No, no, not that I can remember. I, you know, I think my mom said, like, you're not doing as much as you used to and I kind of took offense to that, even though it's kind of true. It's like, I don't know. It hurt.  Okay, that was painful for you. What about what your husband said?  You know, I think at first we didn't really acknowledge it. It was like, you know, I took a break here. He picked up the slack and it was fine, but now that it's been and more he's kind of getting frustrated and, you know, he's been asking me about how I feel and why I'm not doing as much but at the same time, like, even though he knows that I'm not motivated, it's still frustrating because I, it's my responsibility. So I think he's, you know, he's been saying, like, I need you to do more around the house pretty much is what he said, I need you to do more. What was your response to that? When I said, I need you to more? I started crying because I know he's right and that's what I tell myself every day, I need to do more, but I don't have the motivation to do it. And so I'm so frustrated with myself. And, you know, I know that he needs that from me and I don't know why I'm not motivated to do it. Okay, so you're frustrated forfeeling down?  Yeah And you're frustrated for lacking motivation? Hmm And just as little as a few years ago, you didn't feel it this way at all? Yeah. Yeah, I actually think, you know, I've been feeling this way more like in the past, like six months or something like that, like I, it was hard for me when my youngest son went to school but more in like the natural way that it is hard. But this is something else this is more consuming. It's, you know, like the difficulty of him going away to school, almost was motivating, like it was hard, but at the same time, it was freeing because I had other opportunities to do stuff. This is just like stunting. Okay, so I'm gonna shift gears a little bit. Can you tell me about your well, a recent day? So it's kind of typical what you're telling me now meaning not motivated down? Sure. Onn Wednesday, I was having a really hard time getting out of bed. So my husband just got the kids ready in the morning and I felt really bad about that. So I just stayed in bed for a couple more hours, probably until like 1030. And I got up you know, I'm made myself something to eat. And then I thought, you know, I should probably go to the store because we're almost out of milk. And, you know, and I think the boys need shampoo, but I just, I just sat down and I just sat there and I think I sat for I don't even know how long the boys came home from school. It was like, you know, 330 and I hadn't even gotten up. And so then I said, Okay, the boys are home. I should probably get started on dinner soon, because my husband will be home soon. And I found I found something in the fridge to make and I made dinner and you know, after that everybody, you know, just sat down, we just watch TV and I just sat there until it was time to go to bed. This is you said this was recently right? Ummhuhh What would the ideal day of look like take that same day and do you wish you could have done? I wish that I would wake up and you know, I would want to wake up when it was time for the kids to get ready to school to go to school. You know, I could make sure that everything that they had everything they needed, I could pay for lunches and get the boys dressed and you know, check they needed any permission slip sign, that kind of thing. Send them out the door and then I would see if we needed anything from the store. I probably do a little bit of cleaning around the house. I used to like have like a list of chores that like I would do different things on different days and different days of the month and stuff. So like bedding would get washed one day in the week and that kind of thing. So I would probably like follow that list. Nowadays I just, you know if it gets done, it gets done and usually my husband helps me with some of the stuff and you know, I would do the bathrooms one day a week that probably gets done like once a month now. But um, I would do that so do the cleaning. If we if I needed to go to the story we do that. I get ready for the boys to come home I'd probably make them a snack and and figure out what was going to be for dinner, I would go ahead and do that. And then probably, you know, sometimes we we would watch TV after my husband got home after dinner or I would figure out something for us to do, we could play a board game or or watch a movie as a family or something like that. And that would be after the kids did their homework and everything like that. And then after we spent some time together, I put them in a bed. Alright, so it's a fairly wide discrepancy between where you are in terms of behavior and where you want to be. So let me ask you a very specific question about one of the first things in the day you would mention that when it was time to get up. Right? You did. So you were awake and aware of it, but you went back to sleep. And, of course, your husband got up and he took care of things.  Right. How did you feel alone Not to happen, because clearly that's not what you want to happen. How did you feel about oversleeping? I just like, you know, the alarm goes off, and I know it's time to get up and my husband's getting out of bed and I just look at the clock and I think, what's the point and, you know, it's just this instant feeling of I can't even describe it like pointlessness of getting up. And so, I go back to sleep, but I feel worse for doing it. You know, like, it's a catch 22 like, I don't want to wake up, I just don't want to, but then when I go back to sleep, I feel bad. I feel guilty.  Okay, so I'm not getting up in the time you wanted you feel guilty, but you also mentioned something that you thought, which was, if I'm not mistaken, you said what's the point, can you expand on that? It just it's just like, you know, when I'm sleeping, I don't realize how sad I am. And I don't realize how hard it is to function. When I'm sleeping. I'm not aware of that as soon as I wake up I am. And so I just have this feeling of like, what's the point of getting up and experiencing these feelings when I could go back to sleep and not have to What's the point of getting up when sleeping pain at back? Yes, yeah.  Okay. But then, when you when you do get up, you feel sad and guilty about having overslept. Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely. So really, functionally, what you're doing is you're delaying experiencing the pain. yeah And then in terms of how it affects your relationships and your family, you're not getting your kids off to school. Your husband's getting real frustrated.  yeah And all you've really bought yourself is a couple extra hours sleep. And you know, presumably without without pain because you're sleeping, but you're not really escaping it. Does that make sense?  Yeah. Before when you felt more satisfaction and purpose, did you get up and help the kids off to school? Yeah, it was so easy. I would just like, you know, I would wake up and, and I would be like, Okay, it's time to get up and get out of bed and get ready to go. I mean, you know, sometimes if, if, if I was a little bit tired, it would be a little bit harder. You know, it's not, you know, as a stay at home mom, I usually get enough sleep for the most part now that the kids are older and everything, so it's not usually too hard to get up and I would, I would, you know, it would be another good day, you know, I would be glad to get up and take care of the things that I needed to take care of and I felt accomplished. So maybe what's going on here? Or maybe maybe we could help you remember, you know, over the last few sessions, we've talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and different techniques that I'll be using and different things we're talking about, sometimes with behavior, the behavior that's useful, which in this case, I'm assuming we can agree is the getting up on time. behavior that's useful has to come first, even if the feeling doesn't match. Right. So sleeping those extra I presume you a couple hours delays you from feeling sad, but it causes other problems. If you were to get up one time, you might still feel sad, right? Because that's why you're over sleeping, as you're sleeping longer to avoid that. But the functional part of being a housewife, as you identify would be completed. So maybe some of those feelings of sadness and guilt would over time abate. Because functionally speaking, you're completing the tasks that you want. What's tough about that, So in the moment, it's easy for me to say this now. But in the moment, like for instance, when you have to get out of bed tomorrow, you're going to be facing that same challenge, which is I can get up now and feel depressed, or I can wait and feel depressed later. So in that moment, it's hard to act on the behavior that you kind of know you want to move towards. I mean, it sounds like you want to get up and  yeah, I mean, I want everything to be normal again. And I guess I never really thought of it like that. Like, I just thought, Well, if I'm waking up at the right time, and I'm just feeling bad then like, like I said, What's the point, but I guess it makes sense. Like, even if I don't feel like doing it, maybe it'll make me feel better if I do do it, even if it's hard, because nothing is really harder than when I'm already going through. Well, it seems like you're, you're more or less making things worse, right? In an effort to avoid the pain that you're going to suffer anyway. You're making the pain worse, and just delaying it a little bit, right. What what thought and we talked before about automatic thoughts, these thoughts that come up when your belief system meets these different situations that occur when you have the thought that this is pointless. Right, and I'm going to expand on my thought a little and say that, you know that thoughts really getting at is I can avoid this pain if I sleep a little while longer. That's a version of the thought. Does that make sense? And also, I guess I thought that, no, it wouldn't really be that beneficial to get up.  Okay. So minimizing the benefit. Yeah. So there's a couple of things going on, right? I can avoid the pain by slipping in. And there's really no point to getting out because I won't do any good anyway.  Yeah. What adaptive response is that self talk, we talked about those things we consciously think to ourselves, could you apply in that moment when you're, you know, whatever time you get up in the morning, when you're thinking about this, that thought comes in that it doesn't really matter if I get up anyway. I mean, I guess I could tell myself like I can do this. Like Instead of, you know, when I say to myself, what's the point instead I can say, I can do this? I can get out of it. It'll be okay. I can. I'm strong enough, even though it's hard to push through the pain and get up now, even though I don't want to, I can say I can do this.  Okay. So that would be adaptive response. I'm strong enough. I can get through this, but it will be difficult. Right? How about the value of getting up early and seeing the kids off to school. The automatic thought right now is telling you that's not valuable. But I think that you believe it is valuable. Yeah, I mean, I know it's valuable. I guess what my frustration is, is that I know it's valuable and it used to give me like an emotional payoff of like, pride and, and satisfaction and now I'm not getting that anymore. So I guess I need to realize that even though I'm not getting it right now. If I keep trying, maybe it will happen again, because it did happen before, it will seem logical that you have higher probability of getting that back. If you do get up, then if you guess that's true, right?  So never get the satisfaction of sending my kids off to school by never send my kids off to school, she had a zero percent chance of successful successfully moving past this was asleep again and you have some other probability greater than zero if you if you do. I never thought about it like that. That kind of makes sense? Yeah, yeah. So even though getting up early is going to be painful and seem like not a practical move. Logically, you know, that has a better chance of paying off for you and I think that with with these type of, what you're going through is probably depression. Right now what I like to talk to you further, to make sure that's what's going on seems like you're depressed, and sometimes with depression, you just have to get one thing going your way each day. Right? So, so I'm not saying necessarily tomorrow, you have to get up one time, and then go make new friends and then go find social activities, right? You don't have to build Rome in a day here. Right? It's, it's more like, Can I do this one thing? Okay, I proved to myself, just what I'm saying, which is I'm strong enough to get up. See the kids often have that one victory for tomorrow. Right and build on that.  Yeah. Yeah. And part of that's going to be playing those adaptive responses back, right thinking of those thoughts. Whether it's just thinking them, you know, in your mind or actually thinking them and saying, sometimes it's helpful just to say them out loud, Not letting the negative thoughts take over because that's what I'm thinking like, okay, I can get the kids off to school, but after that, I'm going to start thinking You know, what's the point again? Like, what? Why don't I just sit down, there's just no point. So if I can keep reminding myself that I just have to try, and that I did accomplish something, and then, you know, even though it's hard, and I know that those thoughts are going to come back, and then I'm going to feel bad. If I don't do anything, I'm not going to feel any better. So you have a good handle on the adaptive responses sounds like right. And you know what you have to say after but you know, what you want to do. I'll see again in a week, and there'll be five days in there between now and my see again, we will have to decide they want to get up as your kids off to school or not, right. So I want you to give that a tryto adaptive responses and try to push through with that behavior. Now it's important to keep in mind that we have five days between now I want to see you again in five business days, right? school days, and you may not succeed every day. And that's okay. Right? hmmm Sometimes the setbacks like you could, you could get up early two days in a row and then it goes up back up third day, don't let that will wash away those successes. It's a day by day fight, try not to think of it in terms of the week, I want you to try to think of it in terms of what I have to do today. Not worrying about the future, and not worrying about should done in the past.  Okay The only moment we really can live in is now. So try to stay in present the moment recite those adaptive responses, and try to push for that just that one victory. Okay, can you try that? yeah, I think I can try that. All right. So work on that and To continue with the homework, that maybe the CBT homework haven't given you and I'll see you next week.  Thank you. Thanks","Patient was still feeling pretty down and feel stuck and not happy and don't know why. Therapist tells that it sounds a little confused as to whats going on whats causing it.

33,"Summarize: Hi, Gabriela, I understand that you're here today because you've been experiencing some low mood. Yeah, I just then recently I've just been feeling down a lot. And I can't really like snap out of it. Like sometimes if it's happened before, I can just like, get myself back on track. But recently, I've just found it really difficult to do it.  So it sounds like you've been experiencing some low mood and you're kind of struggling to get going a bit. Yeah, yeah, definitely.  You've had low mood in the past, but it's kind of you've been able to pull yourself out of it before but more recently, you found that harder. Okay, so I understand that you you first went to your GP he referred you here about two months ago. And can I ask what what led you to go to the GP in the first place? and my long term boyfriend broke up with me and it was such a shock like I really wasn't expecting it. And it's got me really down and felt really lonely and and I didn't really want to see people and she wanted a baby in space and the mom told me I should probably go to the doctors and and he is her family to you. Okay, so it sounds like you had that breakup and you weren't expecting it. So kind of came out of the blue a bit and, and that you've been on your own quite a lot. So you're not been seeing people as much and it sounds like your mom, notice that there's been a bit of a change in you. Okay, and how things been then since then, since that happened and since you went to the GP? I just nothing's really changed, nothing's really improved. I feel down like absence and feel distant from things and like I said, I can't stop all over. Okay, and how did you feel about coming here today?  And I was kind of disappointed in myself, because I feel like maybe else my ages doing this, like, I should have been able to snap out of it. Like, it's just another thing that I've not really affects me make me stand out for the wrong reasons. Okay, so you feel like it's kind of odd or unusual to be here, coming to see a clinical psychologist, I suppose I just want to reassure you that it's absolutely normal to have feelings of depression and anxiety. It's really very common, and it certainly isn't auto strange at all. So it sounds like it was actually quite hard for you to come here today. So what I guess led you to do that because it sounds like maybe there was a lot pushing you against coming here today, but you've managed to come anyway.  And I'm just hoping that it's going to help. I think I didn't I didn't really want to admit it, because like it's just another failure. But my mom was talking to me and, and she's, she's not really happy with the way I'm behaving and I don't really want to disappoint her again. And so I thought there's no harm in  this So sounds like partly you're doing it then your mum because you're a bit worried that she she isn't pleased with you at the moment. Yeah. Okay. And I think it's great that you've come here. And definitely there's a lot of evidence to suggest that psychological therapy can help depression and particularly the type of therapy that we're going to be doing, which is called cognitive behavior therapy. And I'll tell you a bit more about that as we go on, but I'm just trying to find out a bit more about you today. So I saw from your notes that your medic student Yeah, and not currently in the Unii room and but yeah, last year as a medical student, okay, so I guess what, why, what's, what's the reason that you're not in uni this year? and I Like he is pretty tall fast as a then suggested I took a year out. This is the Break. Okay, so just thinking that would be about six months ago was it that your ear out started, and it sounds then maybe like your first year was also quite tough. Yeah, was that I thought we still for everyone, but obviously we'll take it in different ways daily. And you're planning on the panning on returning. And yeah I am gonna have to really so. Yeah don't sound too sure about that though? I think return is probably that's what's gonna make everyone happy. And I think you know, at least I'll be able to finally achieve something and get something right. So yeah, like next year, I'm going to get through it. Yeah.  Okay, so it doesn't, it doesn't sound like you want to go back. I do. And I do. Enjoy it, I just I just don't feel like mate the main man and I just, it's a lot of flack and a lot of pressure and but that's what comes with it and, you know, it'll work out for the best if I go. Okay, so I guess in there's quite a lot of thoughts and feelings about going back at the moment.  And I'm just wondering In the meantime, what are you what are you up to what have you been doing? And I've not really had much on the horizon men more men, have friends owns a restaurant. And like she suggested that did a better way to sit in there. Just deliver a bit like money and stuff because I've seen that in Uni. So, you know, I've done that. Okay, how many shifts have you done there? And I've only done one so far. And yeah, I don't know whether it's something that I'd probably go back to but  okay. How when was that shift? It was last week actually. Okay, and how was it, I suppose I'm intrigued. Can you tell me a bit more about that?  Umm it was, it was different, you know, because it was like I could. I did enjoy it because there's like, it's just different aspects and I had to like, speak to people and like, try to get their orders and try to remember it and stuff. Like, I wasn't very good. But I suppose like it was handy to have some money and, like, get out of the house. So it sounds like you quite enjoyed that then? Yeah. And what makes you think you weren't very good? I just I just bit slow and people sometimes they didn't stand by science, so I'd have to talk louder or quieter or slower and a bit confused sometimes with the orders. And then just don't really think that I'm not really like a friendly. Like, people don't really think that I'm a friendly person. They didn't really want to talk to me and stuff. I felt like I was like inconveniencing them by like, asking them things and getting things wrong. But yeah, they said they said that apparently and most people got like a few mistakes on the fascia. But then again, she's my mom's friend so probably why she's saying it. So the person who owns the restaurant is your mom's friend. Yeah. Okay, so it says you're saying that you think you weren't very good that's because you're a bit slow and you got confused with some orders.  Yeah. Is it? You said it's common for people to do that. Well, on that first shift, that's a she said toes, but and, but it's probably just, she's just trying to make me feel better she probably felt sorry for me because I'm obviously not very good at it. Like, I'm not very good for any things recently. I think she just felt sorry for me. Okay, so I've just been noting down some of those thoughts that you've been having. You kind of So you feel like you're not very good, you're slow. You're confused with the orders and you feel like you're inconveniencing her and she feels sorry for you. And I suppose I'm wondering I mean what makes you think that she feels sorry for you? Like, like such as my mother's friends and she's obviously feeling sorry for my mom as well because she's got a daughter it's not like anyone else who harried and she's just like all alone and she's not getting involved so I think she just feel sorry for me and she doesn't want to extend until upset me. Yeah. When you're having these kind of thoughts, because that's quite a lot of negative thoughts you're describing how do you feel? I feel empty. I do. I'm just calling as it is and just call it as reality. And I feel like I'm being honest with myself by just leasing it and not trying to get around tighten it because No, I can see myself so it sounds like you feel like these thoughts are very true then. I mean, if you're going to write them, so I'm going to pick out some of those thoughts you describe. You said, I'm not very good and I'm inconveniencing them. How much would you say you believe those on a scale out of 100? where 100 is like I absolutely believe it and zeros like I don't believe it at all. About 80 so you feel quite sure that you definitely believe okay. And you said that when you're thinking those thoughts, she started to feel quite empty. I just feel just, like sad. I'm not really myself. I just like it's like I'm not really bad, but when I am coming through Good job, and there any other emotions that you experience? feel drained. They feel like I'm in touch with anything And just like everything's going on around me, but I'm just not there. I'm just if I can just walk in Okay, so you feel empty distance you feel drained and how when you're feeling these emotions, how do you feel in your body? Kind of what sensations do you notice? I didn't know how to describe it. I got like I have a bit of like we can have any kind of got like butterflies in your nerves and stuff. Did you have butterflies that night when you're at the restaurant? Yeah, I was pretty nervous then. But when I got into it, they went away and like, it just talked to me for a bit. And so obviously, I realized that I wasn't doing a very good job. Okay, and when you When you have these emotions, how does it affect your energy levels? Do you feel more energetic, less energetic or about the same? i am feeling down Yeah. And when you're having those emotions that you were describing I feel drained like, then you will have like the energy to wake up in the morning sometimes, because y'll play less and less than the body's having and I don't want to. Yeah, sounds like you feel very tired. You're struggling to wake up. You said it's pointless. And then what do you do then when you feel like that? So I guess you just talked about when you wake up in the morning, and you feel heavy, and I suppose you've been maybe having some of these thoughts and those emotions, potentially the night before? What do you then do? How do you respond to that? I just have to go expose that don't really have a choice because my mom I live with my mom and I know it's hard for her. So I don't want her to be too worried. So I just I just tried to carry on as normal girl takes longer and I don't want to but I do. So now its my routine. So you're a bit slower and gets getting up. Yeah. But you are still getting up anyway. And what about your kind of what do you think about when you're doing that? I'm just thinking that nobody else is like mate my age like, maybe we should be feeling like this. And I'm the only one that does. So it sounds like you think a bit more about the problem and you kind of spend time thinking about hey, how can it hapen to me? I don't, I don't want to feel like this but i do and nobody else I know doors. So it makes me feel even more alone gets me even more down. I just don't display anyone and I should have anyone to it. Okay, so it sounds like you try and toughen up on yourself a little bit. Tell yourself to work harder to be different. Okay. And when you start telling yourself that kind of thing and how does that make you feel? Does that make you feel better afterwards or worse? feels worse because it still can't snap out of it. Like, I'm aware it's happening and I just, I'm trying but I just can't. And then and then it's just another thing that I'm feeling. Just another thing that I can't really get","Patient visits therapist for feeling and couldn't get back on track.

Okay. One of the things that that I noticed is that you are not using any kind of birth control right now. Yeah. And I just wondered if we could talk for a few minutes about some ideas, and I wondered what what your thoughts are about using condoms?

You've heard a lot of negative things about condom usage. Yea yes Okay. Okay. So Chris, it's okay if I share with you some of the things that I've learned about condom usage and some of the things that my clients that are around your age have shared with me about condom usage.  Yeah, that's fine.  Okay. What some people don't realize and don't know about condoms is that may not only prevent help prevent teen pregnancy, but they can also prevent sexually transmitted infections like Flaminia along with HIV. They're really effective in preventing these things. And there's also a lot of easy ways to get condoms these days that some people don't know, the local health departments have condoms and many times they're free. And local pharmacies, drug stores have condoms. And there are a lot of clinics that have them as well either for a small fee or sometimes they're actually free. And there's some some ways to that people have found carrying them around pretty conveniently, you know, in their car or in their pockets because they're pretty small. What does it sound like? As I'm talking what what are what are some thoughts that are going, going through your mind? Definitely changing my mind about condoms a little bit, think there's no hurt and just carrying them with me. And if they do protect against all that stuff that you said, that sounds a lot better than what I have heard. I definitely want to avoid all those consequences.  Okay. Yeah. You're not interested in becoming a father right now I'm guessing. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Great. Well, can I ask you? So after this conversation today on a scale of zero to 10, with zero being that it's not at all important to you and 10 being that it's extremely important?

35,"Summarize: Come in. This is awesome. Yes, thank you. How are you today? I'm feeling really tired and been having this breathlessness you've really been worried about. You came in to see one of my colleagues recently didn't you. Yes. And she sent you for a blood test. That's right, doctor.  Yeah, we think he might be anemic.  Oh gosh. Yes. What I want to do today was firstly to give you a blood test result. And then talk to you a little bit about the condition of anemia, and then talk about some potential treatments.  So right up to dear. Does that sound okay with you? That sounds fine. Yes, doctor.  Great. So should we have a look at your blood test? Yes. Yeah. Here it is. So what we're testing for is the level of hemoglobin in your blood, right and just to show you the normal range for Women is between 11.5 and 16 grams per deciliter of hemoglobin, right? And this is your level of hemoglobin. It's 8.7.  All that slows. It's a bit lower than we would like. So what we're looking to do is to get that back within the normal range, right. Just  to reassure you iron deficiency anemia, which I think you've got is fairly common, up to around 15% of women can experience this type of anemia.  Right. And it's very treatable as well. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yes. I mean, this tightness, so it's just just getting me down doctor.  I must be, because you've got quite a busy lifestyle. Yes, yeah. And I just can't cope with it.  Okay. Yeah. Shall I tell you a bit more about anemia? Do you know anything about the condition? I don't know. I mean, I've heard of it, but I don't know what it is. It is the condition relates to your blood right. Within your blood there's several components, one of which is plasma. Within the plasma you have your red blood cells. And within that you have a protein called hemoglobin which carries the oxygen around your body to all the different organs. Okay? Now if that's not working efficiently, you start to experience the kind of symptoms that you've been having like breathlessness. dizziness, tiredness. Yeah, definitely. Yes.  One of the causes can be blood loss. So I wondered about your periods. How are they? Well, they've been heavy these last few months really heavier. I pass it down to my age, you know, this stuff getting irregular and heavy. And, but you might be right. Yeah, that may be a fact. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to talk to you about treatments. Now. There are a couple of things that I would suggest that you try. The first thing we'd like to do is to increase the amount of iron in your diet. Can you tell me a bit about the sort of diet you have at the moment? So I mean, I'm really busy and I think they have a reasonable, you know, well balanced diet. We eat a lot of ready meals. And then on a weekend we always have a good breakfast it was cooked bacon bowties so so I think it's quite good diet rightYes  teenage children they keep you busy. Oh they do. Yes. I mean, you know it's like having a taxi service you know what with that and and then at work you know so busy at work it just just so tired. I'm just getting tired  It must be hard for you to do all those things. Yes. Yeah, it's difficult. I just feel yourself can't cope anymore.  yeah. Now you mentioned ready meals. I can understand you relying on those for convenience. But the problem is sometimes you don't get the proper balance of nutrients. All right doctor So what I'd ask you to do is perhaps to adapt your diet slightly and include more iron rich foods in your diet. Oh, right. Okay. Before I tell you about what some of those foods are, can ask if you're a vegetarian. No No You know, the reason I asked that is because one of the best sources of iron in your Diet is lean red meat. Oh, yes. Yeah, you're nice day. Yeah, exactly. Also liver is a good source of iron.  No, no, no, no couldn't eat liver. What about something like steak that you mentioned? Would you consider eating that a bit more regularly? Well, yes. I mean state one day to Kaku toll, you know, because now to go good. Yes. Yeah.  There's also leafy green vegetables, things like kale and spinach, a good source of iron.  Ohh the kids wouldn't eat that. But, I mean, they like sweet corn so they can have the sweet conch and they were the same and I could go for the leafy green vegetables. Broccoli, so there's broccoli?  Yes. Yeah, I like broccoli. You know,  Ohh good, good I would go with that. There's other things too. You might want to consider things like fortified cereals which have iron. And what are those? Well, if you look on the ingredients, panel, cereals, you'll see some are enriched with iron so you could perhaps incorporate some of those.  Oh, yes, yes, ill Look in the supermarket. I mean, I've got some of those. We could have a tweak and and that gives me more time to cook or die  could make your life a bit easier. Yeah, definitely I would be happy to vote yes, white bread is a good source of iron as well. Yes. Yeah. No, they only like white bread only buy white bread, but I could buy myself some brown bread. cobs and have it for lunch. Yes. Yeah. No good.  So do you think you could give some of those things a try? Yeah. I would try doctor definitely right. Yeah, it's the other thing I'd like you to consider is taking a course of iron tablets. Oh, I'm not into tablets. Why?  Okay. This can be a really effective treatment for iron deficiency anemia. And what it does is it supplements the amount of iron and iron you're getting in your diet. So will that be short term, yes, yes. Often people respond very well to those. You can have some side effects. Sometimes they can upset your tummy if you have them on, you know, on an empty stomach. So Do you take them after a meal? All right you how to remember to do that? Yes. Yeah. I think those two things adapting your diet and taking a course of iron tablets, I think he might respond very well to treatment.  Yes. Yeah. Have a go. Doctor how do you feel about the information I've given you so far outside? Yes, I'll definitely try if it makes me feel any better. It's worth it. Yes. Excellent. Yeah, excellent. I've given you quite a lot of information about anemia today. I've got a leaflet here about anemia, which I thought you might like to take home and read in your own time.  Ohh thank you. Yes, yeah. Oh, yes. Yeah, I'll read this talk. This is sometimes difficult to remember what what your tells so yes, having a look at this at home would be really helpful.  That's right. Yes. That's right. So just to check that I've explained things to you correctly, that you could just recap on the the two treatments that you're going to try what you said that the Navy was due to a lack of iron and I can get this from Having some red meat I mean, steak lamb chops would that be?  Yeah. Yeah. And green vegetables and wholemeal bread and have these iron tablets and you know, hopefully I'll feel better. Thank you.  Yes, excellent. So what I'd like you to do is come back in a couple of weeks, and then we can see how you're doing.  Yeah. Have you got any questions? Are there any other tests I'll have to have? I think at this stage, when you come back to see me again, we'll do another blood test and check on your hemoglobin level than if you haven't, if it hasn't gone back into the normal range. It might be then that we look at doing some other investigations. But I don't want to worry about that. At this stage. I think let's see how you do with the dietary change in the iron tablets. And we can discuss that next time. All right, thank you. Yes.  Is there anything else? No, I think that's it. Thank you. Okay. Well, good to see you. And I'll see you again in a few weeks. Okay. Thank you. Bye bye.",Patient was feeling tired and worried about feeling breathlessness. She had sent for a blood test by therapist colleague. Patient had anemia.

I take a test, I mean I know lot of information and I sit down and take the test and it's like I can't I can't recall because I'm so anxious about this test even though there was anything physical thought there? Yeah, I think it's a lot of thoughts in my head and it is very physical. I mean, I get sweaty, I get sweaty palms, my heart starts racing, you know, I get tense. So it's it is physical. so Yeah,  Do you remember what thoughts going on? Um, my thoughts are like, I'm in the car. I'm gonna get hit. If I'm taking a test, it's like, Okay, I gotta do well on this test. I gotta remember this, there's so much to remember, and I just kind of brings freezing a little bit and I'm panicking because I can't remember. So I guess. So have you found that? No problem, which was not being able to complete the task? Four is it worth once you go through? Um, is it like anxiety over when I finished the test? Yeah, yeah, after I'm finished. I mean, I know I could do perform better if I was going because I knew it wouldn't take me as long if I wasn't anxious. Um, it seems to me like time tests and so when it's over, whether it's an hour or two hours or however long it is, maybe it's over. You know, I'm anxious during it but when it's over. Yeah, it kind of subsides just like in car Like when I get to the place after I'm off the interstate and stuff, it seemed to subside. So when the situation is over, it seems to seems to go down.  So sounds like you might need to find something that helps. Yeah, I also think that the time, tell me in the moment because these are things that I mean, I can't avoid. I mean, even in my job to I've got to go my field placement. I've got to do these group settings, you know, I've got to do, and kids are crazy. They're disrespectful, like, Okay, I got to do it, though. So all these things I have to do. I can't change them and my wife right now, so got to figure out how to deal with it better. Would you like to describe that? yeah, I'm very eager to learn something that can make a difference. Well, there's something called grounding do you know? No just lectricity grounding, you know that third floor thing, that's only grounding I know. I need to be grounded. That sounds good. Bring it on So with grounding, a lot of people have a lot of emotions, okay to have emotions, but for some people, it gets really intense like, a lot and no one wants to bring that down to more of a calm place. So it doesn't necessarily solve the problem like there's still traffic. Yeah, nothing's going on, which just helps you get to a place to deal with That sounds good. So I'm going to introduce a grounding technique to you, okay, and involves some deeper events in closing the eyes and getting to your senses. Okay, so I have a little script. Okay okay. Okay. They'll tell me after. I'd be like, okay, okay, okay. But somebody gave me I just want to know relax, comfortable, comfortable resting Hands on your side whatever was working for you pretty good. I don't want you to disappoint, Chest rises, So don't worry about it. Just okay what is comfortable now we're gonna gauge and use in each of the five senses. And so for that I want you to, close your eyes, I want You to listen to my voice read my instructions So let's begin to relax by just noticing all the sounds around to start with.  the air conditioning going on over the air coming through for the constant noise? Umm yeah notice the sound before like that? No just hearing it now let's move on to smell  do you smelling anything?  just totally okay, a lot of sense right now in this room is for smelling bad or good it's just normal Yeah, no any smelly smells nice no air. Now to open up about site, so I'm just listening something so as you can see in this one right now you picture right there dear or whatever it is. What about the colors of what you see on? blue, red and a lot of bage orange clashing colors. red and orange is one of those go together. Yeah, when he first came here Did you notice ? mean, I might have noticed some of it but I'm obviously more aware because I'm really focusing on it right now. So I'm more aware of it right now. And so maxwidth taste Notice I can just tell you some other situation you can take the time to like snack or something. Talk about the taste the texture. Well, it's totally the food and feel. Okay? okay. You can still do even without food just simply face enough saliva. Okay? Okay. Okay something new this morning? well, kind of granola bar and banana earlier. So get some tea, just the flavor right now my mouth is probably the tea that I just had most recently. And then finally we'll touch on science. So when you hands on right now? I've had this kind of a habit of mine to kind of  feel my hands. My hands are supposed to be here describe to me how it feels? It was solid or solid soft rubber or anything like that secure like okay, it's it's gonna hold me. That's good feeling comfortable just comfortable. So what we're just able to just went through each of the senses as a way of a bit of extraction from here. This also can be called a lying down to the details and then something else at the end, you can say, So, how does that feel? Well, wow. He kind of did calm me down. I mean, I was kind of getting anxious telling you what made me anxious. And so I was kind of revved up, and then I kind of forgot about it, because I was focusing on you know, what I was seeing and what I was feeling and when I was, you know, all my senses of so it was very distracting. Damon a good way I got my mind off of that, and kind of got me on to something else. And then, yeah, they really did cut me down. Was there a certain sense that you weren't most help? troubling right here since I'm not eaten? Probably what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing those two things seem to be most helpful in this situation. Yeah, that feeling too. So let's talk about how we can use this because obviously can't close your eyes, right?  True True, true true.  So what can you do I drive sensors can be used? seen, obviously, my eyes better be open, I better be observant about what I'mfeeling. I got my hands on the wheel. So I'm going to be feeling something So in hearing you know so sort of hearing  Do you have any kind of peacefulness? Well, it's good idea was wasn't in the MPR and sometimes that's good sometimes that's not good you know don't necessarily call me down sometimes I can get so I should probably I could I can listen to some more soothing music. Something that calms me down more also. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think the music might be more because not that I want to be distracted from the cars. But I think my music might call me down more than having nothing, you know, like, quiet and hearing the cars growth might I can see That might make me nervous. I need to be aware of them. But I think I want to hear music. So I'll try that. Yeah. Yeah, I'm focusing on the car in front of you Yeah. Yeah. Not necessarily one behind me that might hit me too much for that. So okay. Okay, now let's think about when So what sensors. Can we tap into? Well, when I'm looking at definitely I need to focus on because I'm reading something of course and I'm feeling my pin most of us on the computer. So I'm feeling the typewriter. typewriter keyboard so that's a sense of touching things. But I got to focus on and seen as paying attention to the words on the front of me. The hearing? I like to be quiet for just So not too much about the function of things like when you have to type on the keyboard you know Okay. Okay. So the next time when you try to tap into the census, okay? If you want to take just a five minute break and so for each sense that a one minute okay, like before I start the test or before I start to drive or something Okay, okay to kind of do that. Okay. And also your statement. Okay. Which I can do this. gussto Okay, I can do this. Okay, so when you will do this? Well, I got to drive home. So probably today when I drive home, I could do that. A test I don't really have a test till next week, but when I drive all the time and so every day you know, before we even we, yeah, so when you're sitting? Okay, get ready and I call her in the parking lot. Okay, took that time, take a few minutes to go through all the senses. Focus on that. Put some soothing music on say I can do itand then proceed. Okay. So that's okay. I'll try that. Yeah. See how it goes? We'll talk about it. Okay. Thanks. Yeah, sure. I'll take some practice. Okay, because the situation right now.  Yeah. Okay. Don't try to focus too much on. Okay? make you aware of your surroundings, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, thanks for that.
