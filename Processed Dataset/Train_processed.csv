0,"Summarize: Well, I could see these types of decisions where you're talking about potentially breaking families up and having real consequences to families. I could see how these decisions could be. I'm sure there's guidelines you are supposed to follow that you really don't have a whole lot of choice in. But you could also really agonize and overanalyze a decision like that because the consequences are so great. Maybe somehing that could be happening. Yeah, I think so. I mean, you're right. To a certain extent, we have guidelines and everything like that. But I also feel like certain things, it just isn't black and white, and I have to make a judgment call. And I used to trust my judgment, but now I feel like how do I know that I'm making the right decisions? Yeah. Well, and this is really the one of the key parts of what may be causing this distress. We talked about this insecurity. You're on this I'm sure. And so you know, one question may be, did you make a efficient or less efficient decision with this particular family but the larger question is, you as a person can you can you do this, this job and if you do it and make money Like, what would you do then? Could you go through this again? Yeah, I think that's where the fear is, is that if 99 times out of 100 I do it right, there's still gonna be that one that I messed up. And I'm starting to feel like that one mistake could be like, life changing for somebody. And it could be you certainly in a job where, like, most jobs where mistakes have consequences. You also do a lot of good for a lot of people. So by you not being in the field. They're not getting the benefit of the skills you have. I guess that's true. Like, yeah, maybe somebody else could come and replace me but do I think that they would be better at it? I don't know. I feel like I was pretty good at it before I started. have all these doubt. So, so mostly This was good until recently. Well, alright, let's look at this from another point of view. You really seem like, you can empathize with these families. You really, to me, it seems like you really know what they're feeling. Yeah I care about them and appreciating their perspective. Take a moment and try to walk in their shoes. If a professional like yourself came to you and your family situation and maybe you're engaged in the activities where it was warranted that your family we've broken up temporarily. What would you want? How would you want them to process that? Like you said, thinking about the caseworker from the point of view of the family? How would you want them to feel that? Would you want them to process that decision? I don't know. That's a hard question. I mean, if they took my kids away, even if it was the right thing, I would want them to be at least a little bit, you know, feel a little bit bad about having to make such a hard decision. But I guess if, you know, if they fell apart, every time that they made that kind of decision, they wouldn't be able to help other people. So from the family's point of view, if you're in that situation, you can appreciate what the caseworker has to do. Well, you'd like to have some compassion for you. Okay, that seems reasonable. Yeah. So now flip back into the role you're in. You made the decision you had to make although you're second guessing it That's separate. Do you have compassion for them?  Yeah, I mean, I think that might be the problem is I have too much of it. You know, I worry about how they feel, even if maybe taking the kids away was the right thing. It's just like so devastating. To lose your kids, whether you're doing the right things or not, you know, you want your kids with you. You want to be able to take care of them, even if you're not doing a really good job at it.","The patient is involved in making decisions that could potentially break families up.

1,"Summarize: Hi, Miss Watson, see you again. See, I'm glad you came back in. I've got the results now of the blood work that we did after your checkup.  Okay. And before we go over any of that I really wanted to find out from you how things are going and what you're concerned about. Well, I mean, I'm, I'm curious about them because I haven't been very well, right. I haven't been very, very well. I've been last week I threw up some blood.  Is that the first time that's happened? Yeah, the first time. I mean, I threw up blood last weekend then. Again, yesterday. So there's something bad going on. I know there's something bad going  What do you think is going what cancer right I think I probably have cancer i'm not i'm not doing very well I just look headaches and I was just let's try to figure some of this out. Okay. When you said you were throwing up blubbery, throwing up bright red blood and was it like little spots, big spots? It was a it was almost filling a toilet wasn't that much. I wasn't like that it was enough that I could see it in the toilet, and I was throwing up. And did did you have any other symptoms? Well, I was feeling sick. So and I had headaches and I, you know, I've got, what time of day was this?  I have headaches a lot throughout the day, throwing up the blood that was in the morning and then again, the other time it was sort of later in the day, but I you know, I also wake up in the middle of the night and I'm just covered in sweat. I know that's another cancer thing. Look, I can understand why you're worried. All right, because throwing up Blood is scary, and waking up soaked in sweat in the middle of the night. That doesn't feel right either. Let me ask you a couple of questions that might help explain things. When did you have your last drink? Actually, just before I came here, okay, so that was earlier this morning. All right, what did you have? I had orange juice and I had some vodka in it. It's the only thing actually that like steadies me enough to get out the door. I don't ever go out that often. But right now, so tell me how it helps you. It's just studies me studies me like I'm, you know, I'm shaking all the time. I'm just like, So over the course of the day, in order to study yourself in order to feel calmer. How many drinks do you end up having? Five? Hmm, maybe singles or doubles? I don't measure right. So is it mainly vodka Sometimes if I'm feeling really like my stomach is really upset, I'll drink cider. So that's its cider or vodka because and you ever get that feeling in the morning that some people describe that they wake up feeling so edgy. They need a drink to calm down. Yeah. It's like the only thing that works for me. Anything that works, too. So in the past week, do you think you've been drinking more? In the last week? Not so much in the last couple of weeks maybe? Hasn't been daily. Oh, yeah. Right. So the longest you've gone without a drink in the last month would be how long? I don't know. Actually. I mean, I don't know. I've got you know, I've got a lot going on. Right. Yeah. So my, my sister is in Boston, she's got cancer and I know like I should be calling her and I can't do that. My mom is really sick and she's horrible, and I'm the only one that Who can go see her? And I go see my mother and she just yells and screams at me and she's got this email and it's just so for all of those things, the alcohol helps. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And does it ever happen sort of by the end of the day, that you have trouble the next day remembering what happened? I guess. I mean, I, you know, my days don't differ that much. But I, you know, I'll fall asleep in front of television and then I'm not seeing lots of people so I you know, there's not big events in my life that I would be remembering. I just, you know, especially now that I'm feeling so not well, that I yeah, there's not much that I would have to remember having that. Have you tried it all to cut down on your drinking? I did. I did. You know, I had a boyfriend who you know, was Sort of casual coming over and, and he, he basically said he couldn't be with me anymore because I drink too much. And so I tried. I tried. I was like, Well, yeah, and then he left. So who cares, right? I mean, right? You find yourself feeling feeling guilty about the alcohol. I feel guilty about my sister, right? I feel guilty that I can't like I just can't. I can't even call her like I can't. Right. So if I, if I could pull it together than I could, because what I understand from what you're telling me is that the drinking helps meet a certain need for you, in terms of trying to hold things together with all this stuff going on, and meets a need in terms of trying to keep you calmer. But at the same time, it's getting you into trouble. It's getting into trouble in terms of relationships, but it's also the most likely act explanation for why you've been throwing up blood isn't why the lab results that I've got are consistent with an amount of alcohol that's too much for your body to handle. Really, really, and that means, ideally, that we're going to work together to find a way to do something about it.","The blood work of patient after checkup is discussed.

2,"Summarize: Hi, Hazel Hey doing today. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I know when we met last time for your intake. You were concerned about some presentations that you had to give at school. Yeah. And you want to talk about that today? Yes. So, in school. I am in school for teaching. And we have to give presentations a lot as you can imagine, on different things and So it's something that's recurring. And what happened was, I gave a really bad one one time. My way of presentation. Yeah, I wasn't feeling very well. And I gave, I think I was just really tired from studying all night and I gave a really bad presentation. And then like now ever since, like when I've tried to give subsequent presentations, I'm just so nervous, and I'm up there like sweating and like starting to forget what I'm gonna say. And I'm just like, a fear of, of getting up there and having to get a presentation because I feel like I'm gonna bomb it. Alright, so was there a time for like, recently when you had to give presentations? Yeah, I mean, like, before and earlier in my life, I'm towards the end of my degree. So you know, throughout program I have. How would you consider those? pretty well, I mean, I consider myself a pretty good student. So normally I do pretty well, it seemed to, you know, come out of nowhere. So this presentation you gave with that received a poor score, maybe it was just an isolated incident. Yeah, like I was saying I wasn't feeling very well. But that experience has still led to a lot of things anxiety with subsequent presentations, oh, yeah. Like, I'm worried about my grades suffering as a result. And you know how long well I'm going to do. All right. So, would it be okay if we kind of step through the whole process of giving a presentation Sure. All right. Just before I start with that, is this something that leads to anxiety? Like right now or other times are really just in that moment when you're presenting? Mostly. It's most intense in that moment. And like maybe like leading up to it, like in preparation that I know that this is going to happen. Like, I always know when I'm going to present like, it'll be like the teacher will say, Oh, well, you know, your this Thursday, someone else's next Thursday. So the closer it gets to that event, the more anxious I am, like in anticipation. Okay, so you start feeling anxiety. A few days before presentation? Yeah, I would say a few days mostly.  When does it start to get really distressing for you? like two days before or one day before that? I'm like, Oh, my gosh, like, Am I ready? Like what if I mess up? You know what if Get a bad grade all these like what ifs. Okay, so would you be okay if we step into this process and kind of break down the steps of the presentation? Alright, so let's so what's one of the classes you're taking now? early childhood, So let's say you have a presentation in that class a few days from now. I just have just a normal presentation. Yeah. All right. So, Let's now move to two days out, where you would start to feel a little anxiety about it. Yeah. What's going through your mind at that two day out point? Um, I would say like, Am I prepared enough? Like, did I do enough? All right. So your thought is, did I do enough preparation? Yeah. Which leads to maybe I did is what I'm really thinking like, I'm not prepared enough as I should be. So that's that's the thought you're having 40 hours before the presentation. I'm not prepared enough. And kind of thinking about that thought. And what happens afterward? Do you have a reaction like any type of emotional, affective, affective reaction to that? So at that point, I'm usually like, more like anxious, maybe like irritable a little bit. Mostly. And that goes substantially unchanged that feeling for how long? I'm like The day before it like kind of gets more intense when I'm like nitpicking like, well, I forgot this or I didn't forget this and, you know, remembering what happened last time when I didn't do so well and worrying about my grade, like more thoughts pop in my head of things that I forgot or what if sort of things. Right, so the same type of thought just more intense, more intense and the feeling is also more intense. Yes.","The patient is in school for teaching and they have to give presentations on different things. Once they gave a really bad presentation and ever since they have been nervous for subsequent presentations thinking they are going to bomb it. The patient has given presentations comfortably earlier in life and this is just an isolated incident as confirmed by the therapist. They fear if their grades are going to suffer. The patient says it is most intense in the moment that leads up to presentation, in anticipation. The patient starts to feel anxious a few days before and the most distressing moment is two or one day before. The patient feels their fear just before the days leading up to the presentation day, say 40 hours before is if they had prepared enough or they forgot something. Then they feel a little bit anxious and irritable. Towards the end, they nitpick, worry about grade and ask what if sort of things. "
3,"Summarize: Hello Kathy, how are you today? Okay. I know when we spoke last time, you had some goals you want to talk about this time? You're ready to do that? I need to Yeah, yeah. What do you have in mind? I just keep thinking about you know, losing this weight and I just really want to do it. I just I just can't get there and I don't know why. too frustrated. Its ridiculous frustated Trying to lose the weight. Now you'd said before that you had a specific number of pounds of specific amount of weight to lose. You still have that in mind?  I would like 20 pounds 20 pounds. I mean, I would like more but I, I've tried to do more in the past and I don't even get past couple of days. So I can do 20 that would be great. Right, and you tried before? And what do you think got in the way? I don't know. I guess it wasn't convenient. You know. Yeah. Just like something always gets in the way, you know, and then I lose focus. I'm not very good at staying focused on stuff like that. Loss of focus. So you start trying to lose the weight and your focus gets disrupted. And I forget and then I make you know, spaghetti casserole for six people and then I eat a lot of it and that's carbs and cheese and fat and then I, you know, will eat with my kids don't eat and then it's just like I forget that I'm supposed to be making healthy choices. Alright, so you know, how to lose weight. And you know, you can lose weight. But your focus is a little off when you're trying and that's causing the problem. Could we break that goal of losing 20 pounds down into smaller units? Like say, five pounds Do you think? It's just something you can do. I am so busy for once a week. I probably do once a week You mentioned the loss of focus is one problem. How about motivation, you feel motivated to move through all those steps like five pounds and five pounds and so on. Right now, yes. I think I would need something to keep me going. You know, week to week, a little bit of that something extra to help you stay motivated. Yeah. Like, when your kid does \their homework early, you can give them a special treat for dessert like that helps, you know, keep it going. Okay. So some sort of activity or item that you enjoy, that you could reserve for when you reach that goal of say that the first five pounds I would love I mean, I've just been so embarrassed, you know, All right. Do you have the activity or item in mind? We could put in place as something you could reward yourself with? Like after the first five pounds? Well, there's a few ways we could do it. We could do that. So you reach five pounds. And then you can give yourself that reward work could be for something you do every day. If that day you're successful in eating the way you want, he would you think would motivate you more? Maybe something every day. Yes, you know, each and every day as you're trying to lose weight. You're aware. When that day comes to close if you had a successful night, they were a less than successful day, right? If you have a successful day, then you could engage in an activity or receiving items that we work out in advance that, you know, would motivate you.Right?  And that could be, you know, maybe watching like a favorite TV show. Okay, you know, because I don't watch TV at night, because I'm so busy cleaning up and everything. Maybe I could just take some time for myself, because I did something good. You know, I just watch a TV show. So let's let's do that. On a day, you know, towards the evening. When you know, you have had a successful day and by what time would you know, in the evening? Probably as I'm preparing dinner, if I prepare food dinner, or if I prepare fun food for my kids, but I don't eat it like chicken nuggets and french fries and stuff. Let's say some Okay, say so by 7pm at that point in terms of the day being successful or less than successful, you know, okay, right at 7pm, you're aware. And at that point, if you have met your call, then you have a you have a TV show that you maybe it's recorded on a TV or something you would watch, okay? And if you were not as successful you would write. So I'd be like something to keep you motivated about the day because you really want to watch that show. Right? A lot of fun. Do you think that structure, that kind of behavioral strategy would give you enough motivation to have successful days so it's process? I don't know honestly, but it would probably be the way right now And this is something you could also track. Right? You could write down days that are successful days or lessons less than successful. And we could look at if there's any patterns, maybe weekends are harder, because they're easier or something where we can identify days that have maybe more triggers or we're less motivated. Yeah, I didn't think about that. Because right every day would be different. Okay, there's the potential for every day to be different with what you're exposed to, and what temptations in terms of different foods, what your schedules like maybe for busier things easier. So we can We can look at those different patterns. And we can add levels to this plan. Okay, but for now we'll go with the TV show that you'll watch sometime after seven, seven, you evaluate how you did, sometime after that. watch the show, okay? That's like a plan.  So that's leading up to the five pounds. Right? Right. Okay, day by day, okay, this and five pound increments, okay, four times to get to your goal. 20 pounds. Okay. Sounds good. So far. So, we'll give that a shot. And we'll take a look at the pattern that emerges, support everything. I say, write everything down. Okay, probably at around seven is a good time. When you know kind of day ahead, write down kind of what happened that day and whether you've had success or not. And bring that in. I'll see you again week. So give us I'll give you seven, seven days to work with. Okay? And we'll look at that log of events. And we'll reevaluate each week. So I could start tonight starts tonight, okay. All right. So we'll give that a shot and I'll see it a week. Okay, thanks, Kevin.","The patient's goal is to lose weight by about 20 pounds but they are frustrated since they are not able to get there.

4,"Summarize: people your age, it's very different for this generation who do have a lot of it figured out. So, if I asked you, how would you describe yourself, and it can be on any dimensions, how would you describe yourself? How do you know that? Yes. Okay. It would be good for me just to stop and ask you what, what is your ethnic and racial background?  My father's of Latino descent mother's African American, okay. So after that encounter nets, third grade, your dad goes, he's Latino. Goes to pick up your report card and to pick you up. How are you treated differently after that? Well, the next day I went to school at a note embed They staple it to show. So when I got home, of course, my mother had to know, they went to parent teacher conference. And when we got there, I was actually the room. And when I got the gist of it, I told my parents how me being mixed race ways to learn or by having two different parents at the time could be a bad thing for me, because I went to a predominantly African American but he's obese something so like, you know, apples and oranges don't mix. You know, Black Black Black History Month came around. And you know, you had a chance to pick some who wants to be a pick Harriet Tubman. No, and I was like, Oh, you're not black enough to be her and they had pictures on the wall. And look at her. She's black. You know what, when you put black paint on your face, and you don't always like to be a slave and things like that. So it became up. I wasn;t hurt and it was I didn't understand that. And I'm sure none of it hurt at that point. I don't think it was. I just didn't understand what a pity party No, but at times, but it just sort of get to yours because there's age where the kids get sort of meaner about the teasing and aren't really even High School thinking. High School, the same thing came up, just put in a Cinco de Mayo. And of African American students are probably one of the Latino students had a problem with it's when I'm caught in the middle. Yeah. I do you think she's emotionally guarded. Um, I think she'll speak to that later in the session. You know, so it says I think there have been injuries. Some of which I'm going to guess really are related to the the race pieces that she's experienced where she has felt judged under scrutiny and it just keeps repeating herself and it's separate from competitors. Man accomplishments and so there is a guardedness and there is a sensitivity and the guardedness is her way of protecting some of her vulnerability. Okay, let's move on to",The patient was discriminated based on their racial background during parent teacher conference at schoola. The patient's dad is Latino and Mom is African American. The patient wasn't hurt by the comments that people of different descent don't mix. The patient is caught between fights when people of similar desent have problems.

5,"Summarize: Thanks for coming along today broke. I've really been looking forward to meeting you.  Yeah, me too.  Cool. Okay. So I just wanted to ask, did you receive that information pack that was sent out to you in the mail?  Yes, I did.  Fabulous. Okay. So would you mind if we just spend a few minutes going through that together now? Yeah, no, that's okay.  So I guess something really important that I would like to draw your attention to first of all, is this issue here of confidentiality, okay. Basically, everything that you and I talk about together in therapy is just between you and I, however, because I am a professional psychologist, the things that we discussed, I may need to share with my supervisor, okay.  Yeah, yeah, that's all right. Will it only be with your supervisor?  Yeah, that's right. Yep. Yeah. There are a few special circumstances though, where I may have to break confidentiality. That is if you tell me that you might be of harm to yourself or someone else. Okay. If you tell me that you've been involved in a serious crime, okay for us. Somebody else wishes to access the information that we talked about in the context of legal proceedings and they take it off subpeona I'm required to give that information then okay. But of course, if any of these things ever did come up, I would discuss these with you first. Okay, that'd be good. Okay. All right. All right. So something else I just would like to draw your attention to here as well. It's just our fee here at the clinic. Yes. Which as we discussed on the phone is $20. Yes. And that's fine. No problems. Okay. And I understand from time to time that things can come up as well and that you might have to reschedule one of your appointment. We just asked that if you could provide us with about 24 hours notice beforehand shot so that gives us a chance to be able to set up another appointment time. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. No worries.  Okay. Did you have any other questions about anything that you read on that shape there? Um, no. it all seems fine with me. Yeah.  Yeah. Okay. So if you wouldn't mind just popping your signature at the bottom there. Thanks. I haven't, I'm feeling a little nervous.  Yeah, I can understand that it can be a bit confronting and scary The first time you come along. Yeah. So I guess, I mean, just to give you a bit of an idea about how I like to work with clients, is that I like it to be a collaborative approach so that the two of us get to work together on new problems and concerns that you're having at the moment. Okay.  Yeah. Sounds good. So the purpose of today's session, I guess, would be for me to get more of an understanding of what's happening for you lately. All right, and give us a chance to get to know each other a little bit more. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's really good. Yeah. And at the end, we can sort of have a touch base again and see how we went for today and whether we'd like to take it on from there.  Yeah, that sounds good. We'll have a better idea then.  Yes, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay. So I mean, just to start off with then I guess, are there any other things that you've tried apart from coming to therapy and As some ways to help you cope with what's happening for you. Umm not really like when I feel ya know, when I feel down like I just stay at home. Yeah, I don't really go anywhere. Yeah. or do anything I just yeah, just sort of withdraw. That's all I really done.  Yeah. We've been really keeping it to yourself and it's quite a big step for you to reach out to to someone today. Yeah, it is. It just got to that point where he just wanted to come in and didn't really know what to do. Yeah.  Okay, I guess to start off with him. Would you like to tell me a little bit more about what's been happening for you?  Yes, sure.",The patient feels a bit nervous to sign the agreement of counselling.

I think I at least needs to go to the grocery. Okay.  Is that something that you haven't been doing? No, not lately. I've just been grabbing food at work, or going through fast food on the way home. Okay. Like, I just haven't had the energy or desire to go and I've also been been working a lot trying to save up money for the baby. Finding the time might be hard. Okay, I used to go every week on Sunday. And I used to already have a list in mind before I went, That would probably make it more likely for me to go. I don't have to be at work until the afternoon that day. So I can maybe go asleep and a little bit maybe at like 10 o'clock on Sunday. Well, lately when I haven't felt like doing things that I really need to do, I'll give myself a reward. And I know that there's this great bakery on the way. So if I tell myself, if I go to the grocery, then I can stop by the bakery on the way home, then I may be more likely to go.","The patient wishes to eat healthy and completely cut out fast food.

8,"Summarize: Hello. Sam How you are doing? I'm good. HOw are you? I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. So you're here at the agency today to seek counseling services? Yeah. My boss sent me over. your boss said, Sure? There was this issue with a couple of the people that couldn't relate to my ideas and my boss solid has been kind of, you know, not working super well. So she wanted me to come over and talk about she wants you to come over and talk about your relationship with your coworkers? Um, I think more just so that, you know, my ideas were just kind of higher than what they could really Understand, so maybe learn how to like how to talk to other people so that they can understand me. Okay, what would you mean by higher, like, your ideas are higher, you know, just a little bit more intelligent, you know, I'm just at a level that other people can't always reach to, you just, you know, like just a little bit higher, sometimes a lot higher, but just on this team, they just couldn't understand, you know, my language or what I was saying, and it couldn't see the vision that I had. Okay, so they were unable to reach your level of expression for this was like a project you're working on? And your boss recognized this difference, and thought that, that the counselor may be helpful. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Um, I think it's good, you know, so that my boss is happy that I went, but I think it could also be useful in the sense of, you know, other people are jealous of me a lot, and they just can't really relate to me. So it might be, you know, great to learn how to relate, you know, like, kind of understand what they're going through at their level. Again, you stay at their level. So are you meaning again, that they're kind of below you with skills? yeah, they're just they haven't they haven't accomplished as much they have, you know, they don't know as many people, they're not hanging out with those prestigious ranks, you know, they haven't been educated to the quality that I have been. So they just sometimes it's hard for them to understand where I'm coming from, or you know, what I can see happening. Okay, so counseling can help you bridge that gap to go to communicate more effectively. Yeah, so I think you know, so I can even better you know, I'm here but I want to be like here. When you say you're here at the first level, maybe like a seven but I want to like blow it out. The park, you know, like if 10 is here, I want to be higher than that.  How would you plan on accomplishing that? Well, you know, I'm always getting recruited for these really prestigious classes and to speak places and people are always calling I'm a really large social media presence when people are constantly asking me for advice, you know, just about everything, because, you know, I've just accomplished so much that I can really help people because I just, you know, I've just been really lucky to just be good at so many things. Okay, so it sounds like you're you have a lot of stress. Yeah, yeah. And maybe, from your understanding that people were just getting jealous because you seem to succeed in so many things. Yeah. You know, like, sometimes people just, it's hard to admit that you're just not as good or like you can't do it. Maybe you don't want to admit that I think I make them uncomfortable because I can. So calcium help you to relate to them in a way that so how would they have a more productive way? How would they describe you? You know, given this level of difference on this, you're talking about how would they describe you, if I were to ask them, if I could ask them. Could you describe sample? Would they say? I think they would say that I have a lot of people that look up to me that I'm excellent at my job that, you know, like, I should really be vice Vice President, if not president, but I mean, I don't own the company. But I should really have a more significant position. that a lot of the presentations that are happening that I could probably do, but they don't want to, you know, other people need opportunities, but it would, it would be clear for everyone if I just did them. Would It be easier? Yeah, you know, easier, better, more people. It would just be it would be a great presentation if I did it. So we'll just cut away all the other stuff. All those stuff. That's what your coworkers would include? Yeah, yeah. Things that maybe detract from them. Right. Like if you know, if I was doing the sales pitches, we could blow it out of the park. I mean, we'd be multimillionaires by now. So You know, it would get rid of all that, you know, the grunt work type of stuff, if I just did it myself, does it frustrates you that you're not calling for every task? You're not recognized sometimes, but I've gotten really good at reminding people that they shouldn't be calling on me for every task. Because I'm, you know, sometimes you just have to show them, you know, I'm better than that person, or I could do it better. And I'm really good at that type of communication. So I've been able to secure a lot of positions that weren't given to me at first, because they realize like, Oh, she's better at it. So they can see your talent.  So they recognize you most of the time. No I mean most of the time. Yeah How long have you been with this particular employer? Um, maybe like six months, six months, maybe? Eight months. Okay. Can you tell me about the job you've had prior like what happened there? an AI algorithm. They, so I got it, I got it to a really, you know, large leadership position. And then, you know, the other VP couldn't really see, see what I was going for. She couldn't relate to me and she, you know, she, she wasn't from the same type of like collegiate backgrounds that was kind of an issue. So I just outgrew what they had to offer. And then this company came in and made this tremendous offer with the you know, it was just, it was just fantastic. So I just had to make a move that was more strategic for me. And you know, that I could that I could even reach more. You know, I didn't I didn't want to be satisfied there. You want to you want to shoot higher. You want to accomplish something greater? Yeah. more. So more stuff. You've already achieved some level of popularity. Yeah. Alright, so your last ploy or the one before the place you work now, you just outgrew that. Can you tell me how that interaction went? Like? Did you quit? Or did they encourage you to leave? Like, what happened to kind of the last moments of that job? Um, well, I mean, So you initiate it and you quit. At the same time. They had a few issues with type issues they have. They just said I you know, I talked too much or something like that, or I think there was an issue with somebody I was working with or something. But it was really it was another situation that just didn't. We just we weren't, we weren't communicating well, but in the end I had to do what was best for me. So because afterwards they were calling me and trying to get me back, but I was already here so that I wasn't gonna go back there. So I have to quit the pursuit you to come yet for them again. Yeah. Which I told them was gonna happen. You predicted that when you left Yeah, it was like you're gonna you're gonna miss me cuz I'm the reason this company is flourishing. So what did you tell them when they offered you the chargeback that I was had gotten a phenomenal job and it was way better and that they lost it and they could just deal with it. So you rejected them at that point, okay. Yeah. And I, you know, I want to make my boss happy, but I feel like it would be good. You know, I don't want to make people feel bad because they're inferior to me. And because they're not as successful. So if I could learn how to even talk with them so that I'm not, you know, so they don't feel bad about themselves. It's your boss putting, I mean, she encouraged you to come here today. Is she putting any pressure on you? Like, is this something that's strongly encouraged mandatory? I think it's strongly encouraged. I think she has a promotion for me in mind. So it's probably just to set me up for that. So she's trying to help you for the future. Another advancement. So Sam, I'm going to get you on the calendar is to see a counselor open later this week. Is that work for you? okay? That does. So I'll get you set up for that. I really appreciate you taking the time with me it was helpful origin to see a counselor and we'll go from there.  Yeah. Sure. Thank you","The patient feel they are superior to others. The patient feel they are so intelligent that other people can't reach their level.

The patient thinks they should be at a more significant job position at their job. The patient feels they should be all the presentations at work since it would be clear for everyone if they did. The patient feels recognized at job most of the time. In their previous job, they were at a large leadership position.

9,"Summarize: Are you doing today? Alright, thanks. How are you? I'm doing okay. Thanks for asking. I understand you've been having some symptoms that have been bothersome to you. Yeah. Can you tell me about those? Yeah. Um, for about the last six months or so, I have have this position at work where I have to make a weekly presentation to other managers about 10 people. And I, every time I have to do this, I lose it. You lose it every time you have to make a presentation. Yeah. Tell me what would involve losing it. Um, I, you know, I'm usually one of the last people to go and you know, as just keeps going more and more and more and more nervous. You know, it's it starts where I feel, I feel like butterflies in my stomach. And that just becomes more intense. I start to just sweat all over. I feel if my face is turning red, my palms get really, really sweaty and you know, constantly wiping them on my on my pants, and my heart. It just feels like it's going to just beat right out of my chest. And then I just I can't, I can't very it's very distressing. So So tell me about the nature of this meeting that's leading to this. This anxiety. So you said it was a you had to make a presentation about the structure of it. So there's, there's about 1010 people, the the executive director and then the the man have different programs and and we all have to do just kind of like a weekly update report. So none of it's very detailed, you know, just a maybe a few minutes each person to go around and just update everybody else on what's going on. And all the different programs. We all take turns or how long do you have to speak? It's usually just a few minutes, maybe five at most 10 almost or something, you know, major going on in my program. When when in the course of like with this meeting occurring? When do you start to feel nervous? Oh, the day before? The day before? Yeah. Yeah. So the day before the meeting, you start to have similar symptoms, different symptoms. What do you feel Yeah, I start to I start to feel nervous. Usually the day before is when I'm pulling together in my notes, I make like a look a few bullet points on stuff that I want to present that I think as relevant and so the day before, when I'm preparing that I start to feel nervous. And then usually last through the rest of the day into the evening, I usually don't sleep well. That night and then by the time I get into work, I'm, you know, that's usually when I'm, you know, feeling you know, really nervous by by the time I get into the meeting, I'm pretty much panicking. panicking as the meeting starting, yeah. So, at the meeting, everybody takes a turn, and does this brief presentation. And tell me what's happening as with your, your feelings as they're moving around. It's like if you sit at a table or Yes, as they're moving around the table and then coming closer to you. I I'm just becoming more and more terrified. My like, I just I feel like I'm being just drenched in sweat. I'm, I'm breathing faster I and I feel like everybody notices. I feel like everybody can hear me breathe. I feel like everybody can hear my heart beating, that it's just so loud that it's like, any minute everybody's gonna look at me and say what is wrong with you? They're gonna notice you. Yeah. And and there have been times, especially recently really, you know, it's, like I said, I mean, this has been going on for at least six months, but especially recently I feel like I've had to, like run out of the room. I couldn't tell you. Yes, I have. I've ran out and couldn't. I couldn't go back in. I tried and my my hand hit the doorknob to go back in the room and I walked up. Good. No, there's too much anxiety. Yeah, I felt okay. You know, in the hallway and then when I tried to go back in the room, it's Everything justright back up again.  Yeah. So, so you would push that door open, they would all be looking at you. They would wonder why you left.  Yeah. So you just wrote out the meeting somewhere else. And did anybody notice after? You know, after a few weeks in a row of running out, yeah. You know, my boss was like, I realize you didn't make your presentation and, you know, I just I made up an excuse, like, I got a phone call or I didn't feel good or, you know, I stumbled through some excuse, but I feel bad because I mean, this is my job. And I want to do my job. And I mean, how I've lived with this, I feel like forever, you know, because I, I had a terrible time making presentations in high school. I had a terrible time making presentations in college. And here we are again, and I try to be a professional and have a career and make a life. I can't, because I can't perform my job. I want to do my job. I like my job. This is this is frustrating for you. Yeah. Have there been times where you've fled the room? And then since then you haven't. There was one time, actually the very first time I ran out. And I didn't go back and nobody noticed. And then the second time, that following week, I started to feel that way again. And then two of my co workers to the other managers actually started to get into a fight. One of them wanted more money for their program for something or other and the controller was like, No, we have no money you can't have it's a nonprofit, so there's no money. And it was it was like getting really intense. And I don't know what it was. I just, I was fine. Something about that intense interaction changed how you're feeling distracted you something like that. Yeah, I guess it just, I don't know. It just didn't I, I felt I felt fine. I felt normal. So from from that meeting on like till now, have you been able to stay in for eight other meetings? No. She had to leave because of the intensity of the symptoms.  Yeah, I've there been a couple times where actually I've I've I've purposely gone in late hours that I've had car trouble and a habit and I've just gone in late or I've actually just called in sick for the day. There was twice I sent somebody else in my place, saying that, you know, when I was sick, but I mean, it gets noticed. Yeah, and you're having you're experiencing symptoms. When you go Avoid that interaction the room to right because you don't feel good about letting them down or no, no, I want to do my job. I really like my job. I really do. And I like where I work. And I like the people. But the thought of making these presentations every week just terrifies me. And I don't want my boss to regret putting me in this position. I don't want to disappoint him. I mean, I know he took a big chance, you know, putting me in this position. You know, I don't have a lot of experience doing this. And there were, you know, potentially there could have been other people that were better qualified, but you know, he chose me. I don't want to let him down. And I feel like I am every week with this meeting. So it's this meeting, really, you're in your situation where if you go and attend the meeting, you're going to end up leaving it because of the anxiety. If you don't attend it, Have these concerns about the performance in your shops? You're kind of stuck. You're kind of stuck, right? Yeah. Any other symptoms that you think may or may not be related to this intense anxiety?  Um, I guess I mean, I'm not sleeping the night before the meetings. I, I have started to drink a little bit to try and take the edge off. A friend of mine has said before that it's something that she's done to, to help when she's nervous. And so I've, I've tried a shot or two before going into my meeting and  have any effect on I'm probably not a good effect. I mean, I was I was able to sit through the meeting, but everybody kept asking if I was okay. So I got up on the Yeah, I really feel like they weren't. And of course, I was very I didn't want anybody to get close to me because I think it's going. Yeah. I just, I was too scared to do that, again. Any sadness or anything like that? I'm miserable. Every time I think about, you know how much I must be disappointing my boss. I just I feel so I just feel terrible. Throw it down. Yeah. Sasha, I know it's been tough going through all this and the symptoms have been tough for you. We'll get you scheduled in here to get treated a couple days. We'll get you in a couple days. And you can start working with a counselor to address these symptoms. I appreciate you spending this time with me it was helpful to get a better understanding of what you're going through.

10,"Summarize: Hi, Sasha, how you doing today? I'm doing okay. Thank you for asking. I understand that you've been having some difficulty with some symptoms. Right? Yeah. Can you tell me about what's been going on? Yeah. For the past, past, maybe a couple weeks, I guess few weeks. I have these morning meetings once a week at work, and I have to make a presentation. And every time I go to present, it's my turn and I start getting. Start getting really nervous. Start getting really nervous. So your morning meeting at work. And so does each person at the meeting present in like, a row?  Yeah, yeah, we all take turn, they'll take turns. And when you start to feel nervous, when it's your time to talk or before or after that, and now I'm usually the guy at the start of the meeting, because I know I'm gonna have to, there's about 10 of us and I always seem to be one of the last few to go like, like six or seven, kind of in line to present says around 10 people at the meeting. Yeah. And and as luck would have it, you tend to be toward the end. So can you describe what's happening say for the beginning of the meeting, in terms of what you're experiencing? Hmm. Sowhen I walk in, I'm usually okay and you know, say good morning to everybody and then my my boss calls means order. And that's usually when it starts, like kind of starts like, maybe like butterflies in my stomach kinda. And then after he makes his report, and then it just starts going around the room and my heart starts to be faster, my palms get sweaty, and I just, I just start to feel really nervous. I've realized that I might be kind of I start to tune out some of the other presentations. Because I, I start to become focused on how I'm feeling. And I focused focused on the physical sensation being nervous and the mental sensation and you're not really hearing what they're saying. Yeah,  they're saying,  Yeah,  all right. So go on. So So these you have these physical symptoms, this nervousness, what happens and  yeah By the time it it's my turn to present I start. I just, I'm almost like just almost shaking. Yeah, I noticed that my hands are a little little off. And so keep my hands down, like in my lap and just that. I don't want anybody to see them shaking like that. And I have a paper in front of me that I just kind of read from. But when I start reading my my voice is a little shaky, and I kind of stutter and tripped over my words. And I just I feel like I'm not making good presentations and then it's not looking good to my boss. So, so in the moment when you're when it's your turn to present, you're still feeling that same nervousness like that doesn't that doesn't go away at all. And you're trying to hold your body kind of still. Like like almost a cube control.  Yeah,  yeah. And then your voice This kind of sounds like crackly or breaking up as you're trying to read from like, bullet points like wanna?  Yeah,  like an outline? Yeah. What happens when you have read the last read last point? Well when I'm done it's it takes a little bit for everything to calm down. But I I'm, then I'm consumed by the idea that my boss thinks I did a terrible job and that he's, you know, he's regretting putting me in this position and that I can't make good records or you know that I didn't report the right stuff the right information to him and and so, it doesn't really go away. It just it's almost like my mind is shift someone I'm anxious about. Alright, so then the nervousness that's stronger feeling of nervousness that goes away, is replaced by a more general feeling. nervousness about how your how your boss will think of you. Yeah. Because of the presentation quality.  Yeah. Because as you're presenting and kind of staying still and your voice is crackling, he's picking up on that. And you're aware of that.  Yeah. How How long have you noticed? This, these symptoms that appear in this way. Um, when you when I was an undergrad in college, I had to make some presentations from time to time, and I would get nervous when I would make the presentations. And I just, I mean, most people are afraid of public speaking so like half out that maybe that's what it was. So you know, just doing a presentation in front of like 30 something people and so it didn't really didn't really bother me letters. I figured it was just normal and always got you know, decent grades. On my presentation so it never really bothered me. So I really feel like it's only been an issue in the last few weeks. The last few weeks is when you notice that we had we had some nervousness before presenting in college but you just kind of thought of it as normal generally impair your ability to present an effect your grades or anything right. Do you have any other symptoms that you think may be related or even unrelated to what's going on? Um I'm not sure if it if it has any bearing. My my mom, she, she I know she doesn't like to speak in public. And I used to talk to her about how I feel nervous about making presentations. School and, you know, shoots Oh, you can buy it on. It's tiny. And, you know, so I don't know if that means anything. So whatever you have going on, you think that maybe, maybe she has that going on to  maybe the same, same set of symptoms, at least. Yeah. I mean, I've asked her, you know, I've told her about this. And she hasn't been in a situation where she's had to, to do this kind of presentations, like in a small group like this. And so I don't, I can't compare it to that. But I mean, she has said that she's gotten nervous before. Any feelings of sadness or anything like that? Yeah, like after I do after I make the presentation at work, and then I do start feeling really sad. You know, like I said, because then I feel like my boss isn't satisfied with my performance and that he's gonna regret his decision to give me this position. And so yeah, it definitely makes me sad. I feel disappointed in myself. Do you have any substance use going on alcohol, anything else? And now I have a drink every now and then it's very very rare and in these I know this is something recent for you but in these meetings so far, has the nervousness ever caused you to leave the room before they came around to your turn? No, no, I've I've managed to control it, I guess to where I can stay there. Like I said, I've kind of zoned out some times when other people have been presenting and I feel bad about that too because I feel like they have important information to share with me and I should give them the same respect of paying attention but I'd become focused on on on what's going on inside like my heart eating and the you know, my hands and so I can't I zone out on them sometimes, but But no, I I pushed through it and I do my presentation. Are you ever worried about what they're thinking about? She mentioned what your boss could be thinking about you ever worried about what the other workers at the table thinking about? Yeah, times cuz I feel like you know I'm the newest member of the management team and so I feel like they're kinda like what is up with this chick? I can't she get it together but you know there's there's been one person who's been really supportive and you know, she's been like, Hey, you did great today and great information and things like that. So that kind of helps me feel better. But I guess at the end of the day to me, it's really my boss's opinion that matters because he's my boss. Have you ever felt you mentioned you're nervous at the beginning of the meeting? Have you ever felt nervous? well in advance of the meeting, I'm when I'm preparing Like that morning to go to work, and that's one of those like, Okay, I got this meeting at nine. And I start to think about I like on my way into work and but I don't, I don't start feeling anything until I'm actually in the room. So have you noticed nervousness, fairly intense? Pretty much only at these meetings. It's been bothering you for a few weeks. something new, something a little frightening for you. We'll get you set up with treatment. I'll get you in to see somebody in next few days. If that works for you.  Yeah, that'd be great.  And I appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been helpful. Thank you. Thanks, Sasha.","The patient has moring meetings once a week at work for which they need to make presentations.

11,"Summarize: Hi How are you doing today? I'm good. But um, there has been visual, you know, we will work out like my motivation. Sure. Kind of, it's kind of related to that. Um, so I'm in school. And every few weeks we have like papers to write. And I know I know what I know I can do it. It's just actually sitting down and doing it ok will tell me about the papers. Well, they're usually about five pages long. And I just, I just look at it and like, it's five pages. But I'm like, okay, so I go sit down. You know, on my computer. I'm like, Alright, I'm starting references. So I get, I start off good. I do the references. But then it's like, I get sidetracked. tracked so easily. And then I end up killing like two hours, checking the news checking and then it goes to my phone and then just looking at recipes and then it gets really off topic and then I realized I haven't done anything. Alright, so you, you have a five page paper, you sit down to work on it. You have the references, you get that part taken care of that then sounds like you kind of wander off a little bit.  Oh, big time.  Yeah. Okay. And then what happens after you are done wandering a little bit? I get kind of annoyed with it. And then I'm like, Well, you know, I've already you know, it's already 90 time I'll try to do it tomorrow. And then, you know, either tomorrow doesn't happen or the same thing happens. And it's just and then I end up rushing right at the edge of, you know, that's due tomorrow and getting all these five pages done. It's really hard for me So you are you're finishing assignment on time. So the promise of lateness No, I, I get it done.  You get done? It's just all at the last minute. So it's really the how the time breaks out isn't working out well for you. Yeah. You'd rather not be doing it at the last moment. No, I mean, I try not to. I mean, I set time aside to go sit down. I'm like, Alright, you know, we're gonna start on this paper. Then sidetracked. I'm watching TV. I'm on my phone. I'm on some other website. So these so these activities that you're engaging in between when you start the work and before you start writing, also regarding the references before you start writing. You said check an email.  Yeah. And other kind of sounds like unplanned small activities. Yeah. I mean, there's small things that keep My attention but it's not where my attention needs to go. These aren't particularly engaging activities like something you need to do. No at that moment. No I mean, I look up you know, right I started one reference and then who this article looks cool who this article you know next thing I'm know I'm researching octopuses or something. So like distracted, yeah distracted like at work. And then there's a moment you kind of catch yourself and realize you haven't really started writing. Yeah, but it's like two hours late is too late. Yeah, so you're consuming time there. Alright. So you have a few different levels of activity. Here you have the paper, which it sounds like you're okay writing but you're you're maybe not highly motivated to write.  Okay,  but you seem to be getting the references done. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I get some references done. Okay. You collect the material, and then the writing part. That's the difficult part. And then you have these behaviors. In the middle, which you enjoy doing a little, but they're not something that I mean, they're not something I'm like am jumping for joy about it's just something to to procrastinate. So I don't have to do my paper. And I don't think that I you know, I'm not like, Oh, I need to check my email so I don't have to do my paper. It's just, Oh, I should check my email. Oh, I should check my phone. Oh, I haven't done this one Oh, I haven't seen this in a while. But these behaviors still fulfill purpose they they do delay the writing of the paper. Yeah, that's true.  You may not be fully aware of that in a moment. But then you kind of become aware of that later that that's the purpose that those behaviors accomplished was that they kept you distracted from writing. Alright. So the the writing of papers and activity, that's a behavior that's something you're not really looking forward to. What's the behavior That was an activity that you really do look forward to, you know, think about and some level of engagement is there. Well, there is this new TV show out that they just started a new season. And I have it all recorded, like 24 episodes. But I can't find time to watch it. But I'm really, you know, I've seen the first season I'm so interested in it. And I'm can't wait to see the next one. I guess that that would that's, I guess what makes me really happy right now. So so you're excited about this television show and you how you have the episodes already recorded. And maybe one of the reasons you can't find the time is because the time you're using between the two parts of writing this paper. Yeah. I mean, this paper is taking me a lot longer than it should. Right. So let's let's try this. When you when you do write to paper, you're really writing it. The writing part, not the preparing part, but the writing part kind of all at the end. Right, getting it done this the night before it's due. All right. So I want to try a couple different behavioral strategies here. Okay. And these might be similar to what we tried before working with motivation. One is I think that it might be helpful and I want you let me know if I'm right here to break if it's a five page paper to break it up into more than one night. Because right now, functionally, at least a lot of what you're doing on the last night, okay. would be a more comfortable pace like Like, for example, how long does it take you to write one page? out an hour, hour and a half? So around an hour to an hour and a half? You can complete one page. Edited proof read? Yeah. Okay. So it would take about five days. To complete the whole paper, if you did an hour and a half each day, an hour to one I haven't checked. Okay. But how much time do you have from when the papers assigned to when it's due? They give us about a week and a half to do, I guess around 10 days. Yeah. Um, I guess around six o'clock, like, because then I'm already done eating home from work. And I've kind of de stressed already. Six o'clock looks like a pretty good time. So if you could work without distraction, you would be done by around 730 at the latest with this one page. Yeah, what the one page Okay, so no distractions. Just one page. Yeah. All right. So let's talk about the the episodes, the TV episodes that you want to watch. Okay? How long are they, they're an hour to an hour, okay? And once a time that you could watch those, you get the maximum enjoyment out of watching, like no distractions, I guess,  I guess around eight o'clock because that's when I'm you know, started getting ready for bed and starting to like really relax. And, you know, my husband's home by that time and we can watch it together. He loves the show too. Okay. So eight o'clock, so really good time for you to maximize married. And that's a great, you know, that's a great motivator for you. And I want to try to use it as a motivator. Kind of like a reward. Okay, so I'd like you to try to do is when you start, like when you get all these papers assigned when the five, five page papers, pick the five nights that you want to work on it. Okay, it could be Monday through Friday or whatever works for you.  Okay. All right, clearly within the 10 day window, though, all right, so five days within the 10 day window, do you have to turn in and then set that time at six o'clock is when you're going to start because that's a good time for you to work. So let's keep thinking about that when I feel like I'm getting off track. Yeah, that's sure. Yeah. and not have to stress right at the end. Yeah. And not waste that time in the middle. Yeah. Right. That's, that's really eating more time and your show takes I see where you're gonna. Absolutely. Does this make sense to you understand kind of, yeah, you know, that helped me power through and not do things unrelated by you think well, if I get this paper done This page doesn't need to watch my show later. And I think that's a that's a helpful way to think about it. And that's, that's the cognitive part of this. So this is a kind of this is a behavioral strategy because we've talked about these in the past, right? This is behavioral strategy, the cognitive pieces, when you find yourself wandering, I think you have to detect that. And you I think you have some level awareness that's happening. Yeah, you have to detect that and say, I want to watch my show, and we're looking forward to it.  Okay. And that's your motivation to move through the paper. And then you know, when eight o'clock comes, okay. All right, that sounds like a plan. All right. Very good. So let's try that for. I'll see again in roughly two weeks. Yep. All right. Thank you. So a few weeks. All right. Thank you. Thanks.","The patient wishes to work out motivation to write papers. The paper is five pages long and they start with references. Once they complete the references, they get sidetracked easily. The patient ends up killing two hours of their time and rush to do everything at the last minute. The therapist clarifies the patient is not highly motivated to write. The therapist suggests to break down five page paper into five days and pick the evenings at six o' clock in the 10 day window when they wish to do. The patient could reward themselves if they are successful by watching their favorite TV show in the night which will be a great motivator. The therapist explains this is cognitive part of behavioral strategy and confirms to meet again in roughly two weeks."
12,"Summarize: How are you doing today? Good. What's been going on? Been a little anxious about a shopping habit that I have talk about that? Yes, Well, I have to buy everything in pairs or in twos. And if I only have one thing I won't buy it I'll put it back or I'll look around the store for another thing so that I have two things to buy.Y So when you go into store, if you just have one thing you want to buy one item you went there for you will buy a second item or even more just Second, sometimes it can be more as long as it's reached the minimum of two. So you have to leave having purchased a minimum of two, right? Or if you can't find something else, you won't buy it at all. Exactly. So So zero would also be acceptable. Zero would be acceptable. But one,  no, no, no, I can't do just one guy can't do one. Okay. Now, it's got to be two or more. And what happens that has ever been the occasion where you've only purchased one thing? I can't really remember one. I'm sure there has been but I can't really remember one.  So for all this period of time, you have successfully either purchase nothing, or two or more items. Oh, yeah. I have to it's very anxiety producing if I don't know how anxiety producing it, I just feel like something bad will happen. If I don't keep it to two or more. You know, what would happen? give a specific. Well, for example, like my family would be in a car accident, or I would hit deer or you know, get fired from my job. So something really, really bad will happen. This is hurtful for you. This is causing you pain.  Yes. And this would happen. This would really happen on any shopping trip where you just want one thing you'd be reminded, so if you went in wanting more than one thing, it's not a problem, right? It's if I only really need one thing And then I can't just buy that one thing that I need. Alright, so how often does this happen? Where you are in a situation where you want to make a purchase of just one item? And you have to you have to change because the anxiety  daily, daily? yeah, because I mean, if I go grocery shopping or if I go clothes shopping or for any kind of money transactional thing, you know, which I would encounter daily pretty much it happens I would like fill up your car gasoline. Oh then oh bipac accom. So it has an effect that level two. Yeah. So you're thinking it almost like the number of transactions has to be more than one. I mean, it has to be two or zero. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. No. Or vitamins or number of transactions? Yeah. Because see if I get gas, then I have the gas in my car. That's the thing. That's one transaction and one thing and one thing, okay. And then. Okay, so that's one product, right? And you need another product. Right? So you really can't feel your car without going inside the station. Store. NO So it doesn't matter that there's more than one gallon going in, is because it's the same product.  Exactly. Yes. So I could see now this, this would be more of a daily thing. You said, Right. Yeah. Because at first I was thinking daily. That's a lot of individual shopping trips, but it applies to all transaction.  Exactly. Yeah. I did really realize that that way. But it does. Yeah. Yeah. So this is a fairly significant source of anxiety for you. Yes, it is. It does. Pr I get, you know, like, builds up in me and I feel it. So let's talk about that. And help me to understand this better. So let's say that you went to a convenience store, and just had one thing in mind, what might be a potential item that you would gum? gum, right? So you want to go in and you just want to buy a pack of gum. That's all you really want. That's why you stopped at the store.  Right  So you go in, you have any thoughts? Now we talked in the past about automatic thoughts, these thoughts just kind of come in, right. So are there any thoughts in there happening when you're walking into the store? Yeah, I start. I start with what do I need? Why am I here? You know, I need a pack of gum. And then it's instant anxiety that what else am I gonna get? What else can I get to make it the two? All right. So the thought is What else can I get? Yeah, like this one, the past will be two has to be two. It has to be two. That's not that's Yeah. So that's also possible more demanding. Yeah. So it has to be. Yeah. So I guess the first thought is what else? What else do I have to get? Yeah. And then so jumps right to the anxiety. So is the anxiety It starts going down. Okay, so it's really gradually Yes, but it is really it is really Yes. Once it completely gone. When I'm done that Alright, so you so really the the worst anxiety would be approaching the store entering in that moment of uncertainty. When you don't know the second Yeah, absolutely. All right. Okay. So if you could relieve that anxiety, that would be one of your goals.  That would be fantastic. Fantastic. All right. So let's think about this way. Do you? Do you know the reason that you do this? You have any guesses? I would guess that. I mean, we've talked about you my dad had some bad experiences I had I sound awful. Yeah, they've, they were difficult. So I wonder if that's not somehow linked to this behavior somehow. Being impossibly Alright. So you've been through some really tough times to put it mildly. And what You're afraid of if you only buy the one item? Is something safety related happening? Yes. Yes. Like the car accident or the Yes. Safety. Definitely my personal safety or my family's safety. And I guess security like the security Yeah. And yeah, security. So safety and security. They're at risk for you. Yes. When you don't follow this role, the rule and I will Yeah. So if we think about it in terms of the cognitive model, we talked about the core beliefs and the intermediate beliefs, which are the attitudes and assumptions expectations, so the core belief here the only thoughts when it might be well, now that you said that, or you know, pointed out those safety security issues, I didn't really realize that but it is. Maybe that just that I'm not okay, I'm not I'm not okay. I'm not safe. I am vulnerable, vulnerable. Yeah, I'm vulnerable. Am I an exposed? exposed to danger to? Sure at risk? Yeah. That's my rule. And then when a situation presents itself, which would be an impending transaction. That's the situation we talked about how the situation blends together. With that, in this case rule that intermediate. So when they come together, what's that automatic thought? When the situation and trends potential transactions approaching you, and you handed me a belief I need to buy everything in tears. What else am I getting in? And then what's the behavior? That is a product of that automatic thought of I do you buy the second item? Yeah. And the feeling is the feeling of falls. that follows that purchase of well, the follows on Mac thought, oh, anxiety, anxiety, and then what's the feeling that follows the purchase? Yeah. Relief relief. Alright. So can you see how the mechanism what's happening to you could be explained one explanation through through the cognitive load there much it didn't sit very well. Alright. So let's talk about the rule of the Rule of Two. Now we, we, we talked before, we're talking about cognitive therapy, about useful and less than useful thoughts, right? functional and less functional or dysfunctional. thoughts. Do you think that sitting here now, not so much necessarily in the store? I know that's probably a different thought process. But talking with me now, do you see a causal connection between purchasing two items and a safety or security breach? Yeah. I mean, there's no I recognize you recognize your Work and stuff that it's not. It doesn't make sense. It's not a useful, a useful thought maybe it's not a useful in this case thought munei useful intermediate belief. Yeah, yeah. So you recognize that you appreciate that. There is not a link between Elio purchasing here. And in either direction, though, right meaning, so you realize that, that if you buy to, this doesn't necessarily keep you safe either. So you can't introduce safety or the process of risk of being unsafe, you can't introduce risk or safety through your transacting behavior. That's very true. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. It really does. I Can't it doesn't make what you're saying makes sense. But it doesn't make sense to introduce safety or either side of the point. So do overs or rest are not influenced by your behavior. Yeah. But that's not what your mind is telling you. That's not what your thoughts are telling you. That's logical. And you can sit here with me. And it's not easy to say, but you can say, Yeah, I don't see a link. Yeah, I don't see a link, but I know what I feel and what I feel is that impending doom, if you will. So let's talk about that moment. So in this moment, maybe a little anxious now, but you can kind of see how, right you can't protect yourself or cause harm to yourself or anyone else. By buying to or failing to buy to write in the store, or wherever you make the transaction, different story. So you have, let's, let's go a different direction. I talked about how you walk into a store, and you think, well, I get those the phone, right? And you end up getting something else. Yes, the anxiety then kind of goes away. And we'll come up the next time that happens. But it's a way it's gone for that moment. So, I want you to kind of stay with me as I go through another scenario. And you maybe have figured out what I'm going to do here, but I need it in your scenario. Okay. So maybe GM isn't the ideal example but you see my right yeah. See, you go into the now you go to the store, you realize you only have enough resources to make the one transaction and you really want it so zero is not. So, now walk me through the thoughts and the feelings what I would normally do or what I would think would happen I would panic. I mean not panic, like break down or something, but I mean it would be very, very stressful if I absolutely had to get that item. Um, I would probably try to scrape change out of my car, but I know we're not going there now. Yeah, no stay there. But um, I would be very, very difficult. Could you do it? I'm physically capable of doing it. Okay. And that is one level of being able. But how about in terms of your thinking? And your feeling? I could do it, I could do it. I could get through it. And what would happen? How much anxiety with you experience and with the anxiety fade off? It will fade off? I think. I mean, it would have to, I would imagine, so it would fade. I think it would take a longer period of time to fade than if I had just gotten even now seeing here, but even if I had just gotten another item, okay, the world is going to be safe for another five minutes. We're good. How much you're feeling right now? very anxious, right? Yeah. Are you worried is the kind of anxiety where you're worried that something catastrophic is gonna happen? Okay, so even talking about a transaction of one can lead to anxiety connected to this safety and security.  Yeah. Yeah. So you can you can trigger that without a transaction even pending. Yeah. Yeah. really scared sitting here. Yeah. Yeah. is unbearable the anxiety of men's embarrassment? Yes, it's bearable, it's bearable,  but does it hurt stuff?  Yeah, it's hurt me feel bad. What do you feel is gonna happen with seeing xiety about your scenario of having to having to get only one item or having only having the resources for one item and Okay, so it's not a safety and security. It's a it's a concern about going through and buying one item on the rule. Those two Yeah, yeah. And I'm talking about breaking the rule.  I know it's terrifying. This this this skin for you. Because so you're anxious about that. And you're also anxious about the consequences of that. Yeah. So the anxiety you're experiencing right now in this moment with me, I want you to be mindful that, guys keep that in your awareness and let me know if that changes. just interrupt me if you need to. It's not. Okay. So it might get worse. It might get better. So, is there something on your mind that you need to buy within the next couple of days? Yes. coffee, coffee. That's a transaction of one. Yes, so I'll get something. Okay, right. Yeah. understandable, but what if, what if I challenged you to behavioral Experiment. Okay, can you guess what that might be?  To buy one coffee? In scenario two, to buy one to buy one cup of coffee? And then I don't know where to buy the coffee, but leave? Yeah, wherever it is leave. So what are the possible things that could happen? Knowing that logically you can connect it to a safety thing, and you might be anxious about that. And that's real, that anxiety is real. But knowing that the event isn't prevented or caused by exactly the transacting behavior. Let's go through what happens. So you buy the coffee. You're really anxious. Right? up to it, you're anxious to go into driving there either. I would have a lot more anxiety. But I would really have to talk myself through that. Would it go away? I believe it was the anxiety, I believe. So it'd be more painful experience to buy the one. Yes, yeah. But it wouldn't actually harm you. Oh, yeah. No, not at all. But it would cause you more internal anxiety. Exactly.  So what would happen if you did again, I would hope that it would be less anxiety. Could be, could be repeated 100 times. It could be I would get old. I think the anxiety would get exhausted. So really, what you're doing is you're conditioning you'd be conditioning yourself right to, to to surviving just buying the one item. I have a lot more money financial advantages to it certainly. And there'd be a you know what I hope is a freedom advantage which is the freedom to buy any number of miners, the next so what what scenario of purchasing i know i i asked for the coffee example I mean I asked one thing you're going to buy the coffee, but what what scenario could you see yourself being most likely to fall through this? I don't know if the coffee is the optimal situation for that behavior experiment maybe I guess it would there be another item that would be easier to actually fall through like for example, the gasoline because you'd get your car by the gasoline and you leave. Yeah, that would be easier for you. You will be tempted by the other I wouldn't have to walk through the coal to the store, right or to the, the door of the wood. That'd be easy. It'd be, you know, might be That would be much easier. Okay. So we will, we will consider that kind of a step in a direction that would result in fewer symptoms. Yeah, that would be wonderful. And maybe another step in the future if we get there. So it goes with us, but it would be to go into the store and buy one but let's not let's not do that. Okay. Let's stick with the gasoline. Okay. I feel more confident about that. You feel like you could succeed with that. Yeah, experiment. We'll see when we actually get there, but yes, I would like to. I feel like I could actually try that. More so than the coffee. So are you afraid with the coffee that you might just end up buying too? Okay. Yes. So how's your anxiety now? I feel better than I don't have to just buy one cup of coffee. Okay, so that was a stressor. But I feel it's it's miles. But but okay. But it was. But mostly because the experiment that we're talking about somewhat easier And because I think like the insight that you gave me on, I hadn't connected the safety security, I hadn't connected all the dots. So that was very helpful. So one of the we talked about before, what do I mag thoughts like adaptive responses, right. So as you're trying to kind of push through this experience of just feeling car, you're going to have those thoughts still come up. And the adaptive response could be something like, Well, I'd like you to design it or work with me and design it. But could be something like, I know this will actually have a consequence in the real world. Yeah, I realized this is just how responding internally doesn't take away the anxiety, necessarily. It might, but it will help you maybe get through that process. Yeah. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah, absolutely. There's a few things I'm asking you to do. Right. One is to just buy gasoline needed and only by gasoline. And at the same time when those thoughts come up to respond to them with the adaptive responses to compare the two. Yeah, gotcha.  Apparently got it. Right. So I know this won't have real consequence. In reality, that could be one. And if you have any others, you know, you can apply to as well as apply them. I know that I can tolerate the anxiety. Yeah, seems like you've tolerated for a long time. It's not pleasant. It's not what you want. But you can tolerate. Yeah. And maybe another adapter response would be, this is painful for me. But if I can be successful here, if I can get rid of things, yeah. The longer term picture Yeah. And keeping your island moving up to coffee and other other behavioral goals. Like that. Yeah, that makes sense. I like that a lot. So we're kind of attacking anxiety from a lot of different angles here. Okay? Yeah. So do you do believe that you can succeed with this idea? Yeah, I do. It's been a long time. But I that I mean, the behaviors and the thought processes have been in place for a long time. So I think it'll be a challenge but i think you know, it's time Yeah. So well, that can be very Positive so that you know what I detected there was, you're ready to challenge the six idea. Right? Like, I would like to take the devil's courage. Yeah, yeah. So you're ready to say I've had enough. And you can see a clear path of behavior that can help you get through it and you're ready to take the anxiety on. That can be a positive adaptive response, right? Like being assertive and saying, almost like you're talking to the anxiety in a way okay, right, but I'm not gonna let you beat me this time. That's what you'd be saying to the anxiety. I like that one. Yeah. So, make a note of all these right? And you can use the same one more than once. You can mix them up, whatever works for you. Okay, but keep applying them as needed through the whole process into your home, your is your no more risk to go by. It's great. Yeah. Cuz it because I think once you get home really, that's, that's the completion of only participating that one transaction right, you've left and go back to restarting the cycle. So right. you've, you've permanently recorded just buying the one thing. Yeah, so that's a victory. Yeah. That'd be a huge victory. So I don't know if you know the status of your gas tank right now. Do you foresee needing to get gas between now and next week? Oh, yeah, you do? need to do that. Yeah. So if you could try that out. And if you could record kind of in the moment, like after it's over the experience in terms of your feelings, different stages, that would be helpful.  Okay Okay. All right. Thanks.","The patient is anxious about the shopping habit that they have. The patient feels to buy everything in pairs of two. The patient has the urge to look for another things around the store if they have only one thing to buy. They are okay to not buy anything at all too. The patient clarifies it applies to any money transactions which has to be two or zero. The patient experiences worse anxiety when they enter a shop without knowing the second item. The patient believes that this behavior is linked to their personal and family's safety. They feel vulnerable. The patient feels relieved when they buy two items. The patient can have bearable anxiety triggered just be talking about one transactions. The therapist suggests to buy one coffee, and once it is done a 100 times, the patient's anxiety would get exhausted. The patient agrees to try and affirms they didn't feel to link this to safety and security. This can reduce their symptoms. The therapist gives another suggestion to buy gasoline alone and get back home. If they successfully get back home, that a mark of completion and victory to the patient. The therapist asks to respond them with adaptive response for the two, and make note of their experience."
13,"Summarize: Hello stone,  yes. Hi, I'm PJ Daniels. Sorry, let me wash my hands. Call me, Dorothy. Oh, thank you. That's the next thing I was going to ask you. So Dorothy, the nurse mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about your care is but what's going on? Five days ago, I was admitted to emergency. And they treated me by putting this tube down my throat. And I tried to, to tell them and gesture at them that I don't want this tube down my throat. And I just hope that never happens again. Okay. No, I totally understand that. I mean, that is quite a scary thing to go through. And I think we do need to talk about this more, and I'm glad that you've asked it. Talk to me about this. So I had a little bit of a look through your charts. I think I understand why they did it. But did anybody explain it to you? Well, not really. And because I was gasping for air and in the state I was, but I'll tell you what, I'm really worried that this won't happen to me again. I don't want that to be anymore. I'm, I'm okay to to pass this.  Absolutely. And you know what? There's no right answer when it comes to deciding on things that are aggressive, like the two, we really want to know what the patient values in terms of, you know, things that are that invasive, and so absolutely will respect whatever it is that you want. But I do need to find out a little bit more about you in terms of what is your understanding of what brought you into hospital. Well, I have congested Part failure. And I guess there was water in my lungs and stopping me from breathing properly. So I was living in my soul, the ambulance brought me in to the emergency. So they that was how they were treating me. So you pretty much showed up to emergency. And very quickly they put that tube down. That's correct. Did anybody ask you if you were okay with that? Well, I tried to gesture to them that I don't want the tube but they didn't quite pick up on that. I guess not. And, you know, I've had that three times already. I don't want to go through with the two you've had. Yes. I don't want it anymore. Okay. And so so you have congestive heart failure, and it sounds like you've got a breathing problem. Yes. And do you know why they would have put the tube down. Do you know what they were trying to do? I guess because I was short of air. I had a hard time breathing, right? So they tried to, like, I'm going to use the word save me. Right. So it sounds like you understand that. I mean, usually we only put a tube in. If that was the only thing we could do to save you. Most of the time of congestive heart failure. We'll give some medications. Have you heard of lasix? Or furosemide? No, okay. It's a medication will often give if someone is in heart failure, but if someone is really sick, and then we don't think we have time to give it that's the time we would think of a breathing tube. haven't had a chance to look through the chart, but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in. I I guess so. But I'm okay with dying. Okay. You know, like I says, I've lived a good life and if it If the good Lord says that it's my time, I'm okay with that. And you wouldn't put it to No, my know already what I'm hearing from you. Exactly. I'm just gonna say exactly what you've said, sounds like you've lived a good life. You've been through this a few times, you know exactly what it involves. And if I could paraphrase to you quality of life is more important than quantity at this stage. Is that correct? That is correct. And, but you know, what, doctor? How can I be assured that my wishes are respected, so I don't get this tube down? That's an excellent question. So first, I did want to answer your previous question, based on what we're talking about. Absolutely. I agree with you that it is your wish, and we will respect that wish that we're not going to put a breathing tube down again. And then of course, your second question, which is great, as well as how do we make sure this doesn't happen? So what I'm going to do after our conversation, and I do have a few more questions, To ask you but after conversation, I write a note documenting what we talked about that we talked about the breathing too. And your reasons for why you don't want it, which of course makes sense to me. And then what I do is I document a short form called goals of care. And I just so it's a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two seconds, I know exactly what you want, we will give you a copy of that to take home. But I find that's not usually enough. What we also do, what I do is I tend to when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor. And that notes actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in Alberta. And in that note will very clearly state you and I have this conversation and you really didn't want the breathing to so I reassure you, we'll do everything we can to make sure people understand you don't want that to Okay. All Thank you. I'm I was so concerned about that and yes, I I think I will rest now because like I say, that was a horrendous experience. And he says it won't happen again. Okay. I do want to ask you just a few other questions related to this. Go ahead. And the first question might sound a little off putting, but I sort of have to ask it anytime someone is changing the kind of therapy they want. We do have to ask, how was your mood? How are you feeling? I'm I'm feeling fine. My mood is fine. I have no no problems.  Okay, excellent. And how are you feeling overall about life before you came into hospital? Like when you're healthy as healthy as you can be? Say a few weeks ago? I think I am enjoying life. Okay. Yes, I am enjoying life to the to the best I can.  Okay, great. Yeah. And then other related questions, we did talk about the two that we wouldn't put it in. But again, we want to make sure we know everything that you might want or not want. Okay? So if we had to give you medications to get your breathing better, is that something you'd be willing to have? Certainly, Oh, yes. Oh, look at medication, just not the intubation. Okay. And then usually along the lines with the intubation when people don't want the intubation, we often also want to know, if a nurse were to walk into the room and find just by bad luck, you would pass away or if someone just found you at home, who had passed away. Would you ever want people pushing on your chest and giving you shocks trying to bring you back to life? No, no, no, I like I said, the good Lord knows when it's my time. No, and that'll make sense to me with no breathing. Yes, and I have no problems with that. There are some other things we can do. That's not a breathing tube, but they're a little aggressive. And one is have you ever heard of bipap? I don't think so. It's a mass that really pushes air into you. It's a little uncomfortable, but nothing as bad as a breathing tube. Maybe hard to answer this question, because you don't know what that is. But to have any thoughts on that, if you were really sick if we were to try just a mask, and we would do it just as long as you were okay with it and comfortable at the time, would it be for a long time? Now, usually, most times with bipap? It's only about two to six hours for most patients. Yeah, that would be okay with me. Okay. And if we had to put large IVs and lines into your wrist and stuff, and take you to the intensive care unit. Again, we wouldn't do breathing too, but this is just to watch you closely. Yeah, I would be okay with that. Yes, yes. It doesn't sound invasive to me. Okay. No, I just needed to be reassured that that it won't happen again. And and yeah, I'm, I know that on my chart. It's there. Yes, yes. And that's all I need to hear because I was concerned. Okay.  I do want to say that this is not set in stone, in the sense that if you ever change your mind, we can have the conversation again. But if we don't hear from you, this is what will go with no breathing to no registered in the heart. I just want you to know that in case anything were to change, okay. So if I change my mind, I can I will talk to you.  Absolutely. I don't think I'll change. I don't think you will either. But it's just nice to see that you're aware of that. Okay. Um, honestly, I mean, there's some other questions. I tend to ask people when I don't know them. Well, just kind of routine stuff. Okay. And maybe we'll just quickly go through it go your medical history is the heart failure Anything else? Um, that's it. I'm beginning with an ass but I can't remember what it is. Okay, that's okay. We can usually we have it written down. Yeah, your medications. I think I saw you're on aspirin and two jocks and I think two others. Do you happen to know or have them written down? You don't want I always carry this paper with me because I can't remember the name. So okay. Oh, so you are on the water pill? The furosemide. Okay,  yes. And. Okay, great. Yeah. Um, any allergies?  No. Okay. And I won't ask but anything that runs in your family, given your age, they told me you're 70 Is that correct?  That is correct. Yes. And I do have to ask the following Questions completely unrelated to what we're talking about. That's okay. Do you smoke at all? No, I don't  drink any alcohol. No, no.  Okay. And this will be sound crazy, but I have to ask any street drugs, illegal drugs, anything like that? No, I never had the opportunity to test any over the counter herbals In addition to these. No, I don't take any of those.  And where are you living right now. I'm living in a convalescent home for the last six months. I used to live in my own home. And six months ago, I'm moved to a convalescent home. Okay. And how do you feel about that? That changed six months ago. I would really prefer my own home. But just trouble with my breathing sometimes, right? So you feeling better about being in that place now? A new home It's okay. Okay, I really have to adjust. Like I say, if I had my druthers, I'd go back but I guess I have to learn to adjust to this right. Okay. So I think I sort of have all the information I need to make sure that your wishes are respected. Just one last time. Anything else you want to talk about today? Oh, you answered my question. I was so worried about this tube.  Okay. All right. Well, it's very nice to meet you and Stone. Thank you.","The patient was admitted five days ago for an emergency. The patient was treated by putting a tube down their throat. The patient does not want the tube down their throat every again. The patient has a congested part failure. They had water in their lungs and stopped them from breathing properly, hence they showed up to emergency. The patient has had tube down their throat three times already. The therapist clarifies that was the only to thing to save the patient, but the patient argues that the quality of life is important more than quantity. The therapist explains making a document called goals of care which will be available to any doctor who is going to treat the patient. The patient answers that their mood is fine, they prefer to have medications, just not the intubation nor shocks to bring them up. The patient is okay with bipap. They patient has only heart failure as medical history. The patient is on aspirin, two jocks and the water pill, fursemide. The patient is aged 70, does not drink or use drugs, does not use over the counter herbals. Six months ago, they moved into a convalescent home. The therapist assures that the patient's wishes will be respected."
14,"Summarize: I don't want to talk to you anymore. You're all the same. All of you. I have been wasting my time wasting my time. You're all, you're all the same. All you guys are exactly the same. You asked me to come in and just, I don't want to talk to you anymore because I come in here and I talk and I talk and I talk and talk and I don't get anything out of it. You're all the same. When you say,  You are all of you, all of you all therapy, Okay, I mean, I'm having a couple three reactions to what you're saying. I mean, one is that you're saying you're all the same and we're all the same. You're all the same. In the for you guys. Nothing is working. Right. Nothing is working. I mean, I'm feeling just lumped in with everybody else right now.  Well, you are because you're all the same. Of course, you're lumped in with everybody. I'm not gonna single you out. Not gonna make you you know, single you out because you're not doing anything. You don't do anything. There's all this abstract metaphysical stuff and there's no concrete. This is the way to fix it. This is the goal. There's nothing so what's the point? I mean, it's there's something specific right now that I could say or do that that would fill, give you what you're wanting or need. How do I, how do you how do I go from point A to point B? How do I get better? How do I fix what's going on? I mean, that's the reason I came here. Right? I thought there was a reason I came here is to fix things. make things better. So you want sort of a, like a kind of, sort of like step by step description of what something I need something to grab onto something to hold something Grab onto Yeah. Yeah. See, my sense is that you know, that you sort of desperately want something to grab on to, to get to give you some sense of hope. And, and I really want to be able to, you know, to give you something but but it feels like there's something about the kind of intensity of your, of your sort of demand or play right now. Which, which makes it difficult for me to really sort of respond in a way that's going to give you what you need. Or, you know, a better way of putting it is, you know, have a sense that the kind of thing that you want or needing or needing has to kind of come out of an organic process between the two of us and there's something about the sort of intensity of your desperation with Which makes it difficult for you to really be open and receptive to whatever I have to give just the way I am I always come out like that I always sway I get things. So the only way I get that's the only way I know how to be. I come out one of two ways. I come out either full, full throttle, just full, full tilt, just come out and just do it that way or I don't do anything at all. So it's like I one way and it's not good enough and on the other way and it's not good enough so  so it's like damned if you do damned if I do damned if I don't. If I go one way at everybody, it you know it doesn't seem to make a difference one way or the Other and then if I'm just quiet and you know, just fall in with the crowd, it doesn't matter either. So it sounds like it feels like you only have two choices, right that you can you can either approach the situation kind of on the attack, you know with with both guns blazing. It's a good way to describe it both guns blazing. Right or or the alternative is to kind of go along and compromise yourself in some way. Right. Right. Have those two which, which feels better, which feels worse? Well, the bulk guns blazing always feels better because if I go at somebody with with, you know, full force and, you know, hit them over the head, you know, and just and just go at them. Even if they turn away, it doesn't really matter. Because I've already sent my face and so when I say, but if I don't say anything, I just sit back and don't do anything, then it just gets me as angry as the full guns blazing. So it just they eats me up, but it eats me up in here and I get even angrier than if I just blurt it all out and get it all out. Right. Yeah, I can imagine that right that right, if you end up you know, at least if you're going in there with with both guns blazing, there's a way in which you can kind of feel okay about yourself in some way, even though you're not getting your needs met. Right. But somehow they're, you know, sort of giving in, it's like you're giving away part of yourself in some way. So, I mean, you know, it seems to me that the you know, the dilemma is that you have no good way of getting your needs met right now, right. You sort of desperately need Something right, but a middle ground. There's no middle ground. Okay. So, you know, I'm not sure exactly what that middle ground is right now. But I'm willing to work with you to, you know, to really work on discovering what that middle ground is. Does that does that seem worthwhile? I have to have to find a middle ground. Okay, but what are you feeling right now? Just it bothers me. I can't go one way or the other. It's like, try to do one thing. You can't do it and try to the other way. Can't do it. Just I'm just stuck. There's a real kind of sadness there. yes Look at me. The sense of what's what's going on for us? It sounds as if here. You're asking for something. Yeah. I need something I can't get myself. Yeah. Yeah, I, you know, I hear that I hear the, you know, you're sort of desperation and I hear your sadness and your pain and your hopelessness. You know, when I'll do my best to help you","The patient complains that therapy does not work on them and call it a metaphysical stuff. The patient wishes to get better and needs something to hold onto. The patient feel they sway at things, and they have two options. Either to fall with the crowd by compromising themselves or go all guns blazing. The patient feels better with going all guns blazing. The patient gets angry if they don't say anything. The patient wishes to find a middle ground as they can't go one way or the other. The therapist assures to do their best to help them."
15,"Summarize: So, can you think of another case you're working on another family different than the one that we've initially talked about? Where you've made a decision that seemed like was fairly clear caught like one you would have made before and yet you're, you're thinking about it replaying it? Yeah, I have this case. You know recently where it's a single dad, the mom passed away and I go in and check on him and his son, you You know, things are going well, but, you know, I think the dad has a hard time so it's not like it was before when the mom was there. Not that I wasn't there before that but you can just tell that like, things are a little different. But you know, obviously, my decision is that things are going well for the kid, you know, they're gonna he's gonna stay there. Dad is stable, but I just worried like, is the dad under too much stress? Is he really taking care of the kid as good as you know, what if he's just cleaning up the house and doing the right things on there while I'm not there? You know, does he have the energy to take care of his kid? Or is everything really the way I it appears? Or is there more going on? I just don't know. Right. So you're handling it to the best of your ability. But there's still these these thoughts that are coming out. Kind of encouraging you to second guess your judgment? Yeah. And it's like, I can't let it go. Like, I saw him like two weeks ago. And I still wonder if I have other cases like that. It's like, they're all running through my head. And I have these thoughts like, Did I do the right thing? Can I do the right thing? Maybe what if, what if the worst happens? And I didn't see it. Like, what if something terrible happens? And I should have known better. So it speaks back to your competency as a professional again. So that's, that seems to be court this. I think Here are several things you talk about seem to connect back to. Are you capable to be in this field? And should you be trusted? Yeah, definitely. So coming back to thinking there are errors and thinking that all people make. And when these errors become repetitive and you can kind of see them applied in more than one areas of his life. We refer to that as a cognitive distortion. Okay? It's not bad or good. It's just how people think. It's just patterns that people fall into. And there are several different cognitive distortions, there's several patterns that we kind of see. come up often in this work, right as a counselor, wondering, in the situation where you're thinking, the worst possible outcome is unbearable, or likely or both. If you may be really focusing and emphasizing on that, to the exclusion of other evidence that suggests you've made a good decision. I see you're really focused on the negative outcome, the worst possible and maybe even unlikely outcome. And maybe not weighing all the evidence with the same weight, like you're putting more weight on the negative pay, that kind of makes sense. Yeah. I mean, I think that that's probably true. Because before I felt fine, and now I just feel like everything's falling apart and not that much has changed. And so it kind of makes me think that that's probably what's going on, but I don't know how to change that. This is frustrating for you. Yeah. The self doubt is worrying.",The patient has case from their work where they went and checked up on a single dad and their son. The patient fears what if something terrible happens despite everything looking fine. The patient doubt their professional capability to be in this field and can they be trusted. The therapist clarifies this is cognitive distortion. The patient feels everything is falling apart and not much has changed. The therapist adds that the self-doubt must be worrying to the patient.
16,"Summarize: I know it's uncomfortable. Because it sucks like this therapy is just like a not getting anywhere. Like it's just not like doing anything. So yeah, it's like it's uncomfortable to talk about because it's like I don't know. My sense is that you're trying to say something and then you just kind of almost like gave up there. Well, what I'm trying to talk about and I don't know what else like you want me to do. I told you that I'm not good. I'm getting something out of therapy. I feel like I'm being very clear, but I guess I'm not. Are you feeling angry at me? I mean, I'm feeling angry that the therapy isn't working. Like I've been saying. I'm feeling angry that like, I'm still in the place that I'm in. Even though I've been trying. I'm like, just feeling like, I'm feeling like pissed in general, you know?  Right. So, you know, I understand that you're pissed in general. But are you angry at me? I mean, it sounds to my senses here that you're feeling angry at me right now. If you are. I really want to know about it. Well, I mean, I guess there is a part of me that's like a little. Yeah, a little angry. That you're not the Helping me. I came is there because I wanted to feel better. And yeah, I mean, I guess I am feeling angry that that's not like what I'm getting from you even though that's what I what I'm trying to get. So yeah, you're sounding really exasperated to me. How does it feel to tell me about this? It feels hard. I mean, the feels hard to say that I'm angry. It's like not a feel it's not a comfortable thing to say or not a comfortable thing to feel. It's just like makes me like Okay, so I want to push you too hard. But can you say any more about that while you're what's uncomfortable bother. So I mean, I do understand that it's uncomfortable. I mean, it's not something I would like ordinarily say to someone that I'm angry at them, so feels like, I feel like I'm kind of anxious now like even saying, like, I don't want you to think I just like that. It's like your fault. It just like feels like I'm like, that's something I'm really not supposed to say. So, I mean, part of it sounds like is you're concerned that I'm going to feel like you're blaming me. Really? I guess. I don't want to do that. But yeah. Yeah. It is hard to feel like this. I feel like I'm alone in this therapy that like, I've been coming here and trying and I'm just not like getting anything from you. Okay, so that sounds really important, right? It sounds like you're you know, it's hard to say this. But you're you know, you're feeling angry of the maybe you feeling disappointed? You're feeling all alone. Yeah, like you can't even really talk with me about this. Yeah, feels really hard and I want to be able to. Okay. I'm still feeling a little anxious, but I mean, I think it's better feels better that it's like out there. I guess that I'd like said it and I think maybe that helps.  Okay, so let's so at least it's out there. Right.","The patient was feeling angry that the therapy wasn't getting them anywhere.

18,"Summarize: Hi How you doing it today. doing okay, dude, okay. Yeah, I understand you're here to receive counseling services. My boss sent me here, your boss sent you here. What's going on with you and your boss? Ah, that's not even between me and my bosses. I'm a good worker at my job. I get everything done on time, but they're calling me inflexible and perfectionist. So who's who's calling you in flux for perfectionist? Well, my boss has called me that. I've had several coworkers. There was a recent incident where somebody wanted to change days with me, but I told them the schedules that I'm supposed to be here on Wednesday. You can't change it. That's the it's right there like a white. I work Wednesday, you can't change that. Well, they wanted to change. And I really don't agree with that. If they needed a certain day off, they need to go through the order of command and ask for a day off. And they didn't do that. Instead, they asked us which day and then they called me inflexible because I got upset about it. In what ways you get upset? Well, I told them, I said that irresponsible that they didn't think ahead that they wanted to change with me. I am there at a certain time. I'm there from eight in the morning till five in the afternoon. I take my lunch at 12 o'clock. That is my Wednesday. That's always been my Wednesday. I don't know why they want to upset that. Alright, so that upsets you. And that upset them that whole incident? Yes. Anything else that your boss may have as a reason for they call me a perfectionist because I like the things done by the book, which I think makes me a great worker, because I get everything done. You know, on deadlines, not before, not after, right on the deadline. And everything is just exactly, you know, everything's filed. Everything's organized. And some people like to, you know, take a file online, you this to fill out a report and it's there. It's in the file. You can't touch it, you can't move it. That's where it needs to be. So you need to self fairly well organized as employee. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Like, you mentioned you there from eight to five. and take your lunch from 12 to 1230. Yes. How many days in the last say, three months? Have you been late left early? Oh, 000. You know, on there, eight to five, eight o'clock in the morning to five, I wake up at six. I get ready. I leave for work at seven. I get there at eight. Every, the whole day has a schedule. And I meet that schedule. And it's the best thing for me. So this is this is frustrating for you that your coworkers can understand where you're coming from. I just don't get it. You know, I'm doing everything by the book by the Vols. And I'm in trouble somehow. Something's wrong with me because I do it right I do it the right way. And that's wrong somehow, and I don't get it. Have you ever had to work in a, like a group like team with any of your coworkers? They've made me but I don't like it. Because I know the way we need to do things. If we're given a project, okay? It starts with A, B, C, D, and then no, everybody wants Oh, let's do c o, d, and then F. No, no, no, no, A, B, C, D, there is no deviation from that. And then they get mad at me. So, working in groups hasn't worked out too well for you. Not really, not less. People listen to me. So in instances where people listen to how have things worked out, if I oversee everything, I still get on uncomfortable because, you know, they're out of my sight. I don't know what they're doing. Sometimes, you know, I have to watch person, you know, one person, other persons over there. I don't know what they're doing. And if it's not done, right, it's not done right. And that's bad. Can you tell me anything about Sure. mood in general, in terms of Have you felt sad or anxious or anything like that recently? No particular I get, I guess I feel anxious sometimes when things aren't going the way they need to go. Because then it puts off the whole day. And that does, I guess I would, I would consider that, you know, anxiety because if it's not going the right way, one thing goes wrong, the whole day is thrown off. And then now I have to deal with that. Now I have to adjust my whole schedule, environment, and that has caused me anxiety, even by men, even by a minute So if you're, if your day is not going the way you planned for it to go, you're feeling some anxiety from that. Absolutely. No. Does your employer ever have like, unscheduled meetings or anything like that that happens that he does, he will schedule some, some unscheduled meetings. And I've, I've commonly I've tried to call me approach him and say, you know, there's a meeting, we need to know about it. You know, I need to schedule my day around the meeting. He wants scheduled meeting at 1220. And I told him, I'm at lunch 12 to 1230. Why do you think that's appropriate? I mean, sometimes I feel like I'm the only smart person there and the only person who knows how this needs to run. She has some different stressors at work. I presume sort of my home like burying meat, you know, if you go into my home, everything's nice. Everything's where it needs to be. I have my meals scheduled out, I have a nice little calendar. Everything's, you know, planned, you know, Thursday's chicken Fridays, tamales and so on and so forth. So your home life's a bit like your work life in terms of being organized. That's the right way to do it. Do you ever in terms of your home life ever collect anything? Yeah, I do.  Do keep them in your home. receipts receipts? Well it says to keep it. I mean, I've always known you have to keep receipts. You don't know when you're ever going to have to prove that you purchase something or when you have to return something. So what percentage of the receipts that you're given Do you think that you keep all of them every single one I get very upset if I don't me if I go to McDonald's, or food fast food place, I want everything. I'm gonna ask you some some questions. Boom, come back to work, kind of regarding your work schedule. I wash my hands before eat after I eat Do you ever find yourself like having washed your hands and then going back and washing them several other times? No, there's there's no need to do that. Nobody do that. No, you wash your hands 30 seconds. That's it. That's all you need to do. Do you have any particular concerns about germs or anything like that? I try to keep me but I don't particularly know. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where touching something repeatedly like a doorknob or operating a light switch? Seems to lower your anxiety like repeatedly doing that? Not at all. Now that seems like a waste of time. That's that'd be inefficient. Yeah, yeah, there's no need to do that. How about double checking, for example, light switches or to make sure the doors are locked. I made sure my doors are locked. The first time Okay, so check but just the one time well I do it. Well, you know, when I come in the door, lock the door. That's it. Okay. So what do you think the solution here is your your employer sent you in for counseling. Like the change, he wants me to be more flexible to not get as upset if there is an unscheduled meeting, if somebody says switch shifts with me. I don't really understand it, but I'm in trouble at work. So I have to look into what you like your job. I do like my job. I like being able to have everything I need, you know, somebody calls for something, you know, oh, it's right here. Somebody call somebody else right here. I love it. It's like a machine. Right? So you like your job you like how you able to be organized there. But there's some conflict with co workers and your boss you want to you want to try to work that out. I guess I mean, I don't want to lose my job. And if this is a problem, the right thing to do would be to come speak to you not to open to attending counseling sessions and take a look at what's going on here. Absolutely, if my boss requires that my boss requires that then that's the right thing to do. I want to appreciate you answering my questions and spin very helpful. We'll get you on the schedule to see a counselor here. I take about a week and we'll go from there. Okay, so in a week. All right. Thank you. Thanks.","The patient's boss has sent them to the therapist. The patient narrates they are a good worker at their job but they are called inflexible and perfectionist. The patient is inflexible because they didn't accept to change days with their coworker and the patient was upset about that request. The patient likes to get things done by the book. Working in groups hasn't worked well with patient too even if they oversee everything, if it is not done right, they feel it is bad. It makes them anxious and uncomfortable. The patient has different stressors at work, with conflict with coworkers. The patient likes their job very much and open to attend counseling sessions if that is what their boss has wanted them to do. The therapist assures to set the patient up with a counselor."
19,"Summarize: Are you doing today? Okay, how are you?  I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. Yes, um, I would like to be able to kind of I've been feeling a little depressed and I would really like to be able to reduce those depressed you know, the depression. So reduce feelings of depression. Yes, that'd be a cool okay. Yes. So Sounds like a good goal. So what objectives what tasks Do you think that you could do? That would help you to feel less depressed? I guess maybe some sort of physical activity, maybe like walking. I like to be outside. So maybe walking could be one. Okay. Have you had a plan before we have walked regularly? You know, I used to. I did. And it was, it was, it was a it would give me some relief, because I was I was able to clear my mind whenever I was walking. And so I Yes, yes, I've had success with walking before. So Walking has worked before. Yes. And you notice that you're walking less since you've had a first impression. I really haven't been doing too much of anything I've just been kind of at home doing homework, stressing out over doing getting homework done. Because I'm, you know, back in school, and it's been so stressful and overwhelming. You know, like I said, it's just kind of gotten me in this little funk, this depressed mood. So since you're on the topic of homework, which is something you think you can do there, you mentioned that it's stressful and overwhelming. And that sounds like the type of feelings that are related to depression sometimes. Mm hmm. Do you find that kind of being stressed about homework is? Yeah, because you know, is there's so much work to be done and sometimes a good you know, several assignments. Do And at the same time, and I find myself rushing to get assignments and and, you know, it can just be a little daunting. It's just overwhelming sometimes. So yeah. And I don't know, maybe if I spaced that out and, you know, took, you know, did some time management or something like that I don't know, to kind of help me feel like maybe you're starting the homework late compared to when it's due. Yeah, yeah. That's the feeling maybe of overwhelmed. Yes, I would say that. So, yeah, you're right. It sounds like this is just an organizational thing, right. So if you if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier, and do it in small bits, okay. Instead of me waiting more or less the last minute, right. That would reduce the mean likely, I would think reduce some of the stressed feelings of being overwhelmed. I'm sure it would you sure would. So one, make that your sec objective then so you have the walking, okay. And then you'll have trying to space out the homework.  Okay, that sounds doable sound good. All right. Yes. What other objectives might work? Let's see. that worked in the past for you. You know, it was something that I enjoyed doing. And right now I feel like I'm not doing any of the things that I've enjoyed doing because I've been so busy doing work doing homework, so I think that would probably help. So it's a good break from thinking about stressing about this you put it to homework Yes. It has kind of come in the singing parts fun for it sounds like but also there's a social component seems like Yes, it is. It is. Enjoy access to enjoy singing, and, you know, I enjoy the people that I was saying with and we will go and hang out together, go to different, you know, like jazz clubs or events, you know, different bands that were playing it you know, it'll just be nice. It's fun. I love music. So I love listening to it and I love you know, singing. So making music. So that was great. I think that would be a good goal. You seem to kind of light up a little when you talk about singing. Yes, it's I I just love it. I enjoy doing it. And I just haven't had a chance to deal with lightning. so far. This is justmaking the time. Yes, yeah. Yes. Good. All right. So we'll make that the third objective. So we have walking and kind of organizing your homework differently. And then singing and that, that socializing, it's the companies that, that singing that's great. So three objectives is good. I try to get to four. If you have one. Is there a fourth objective that you can think of something else that you've associated with not feeling depressed when I used to absolutely love going to the beach and visiting with my aunt. And so that's two things. The beach. I love the beach because it's soothing. It's company. And I, my, she's just such an awesome person and she's always pouring into me and I just love spending time with her. So she lives down to pitch. Yes, she does. Okay, so this seems like a good, good objective to Yes. So you're suggesting maybe visiting her more often? Yes. Again, just at home doing homework, and I haven't gone to visit her in a while. And the thing is, she only lives like an hour away. So it's not a it's not right. No, it's not. So that's like a, you know, a trip I couldn't do on a Saturday. Take a break and go down there and spend some time with that will be I think that will be helpful. So again, kind of kind of getting away from the school stressors. Just take taking a break from it for a day. Yes. And then also spend time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with. Good. Good. All right. So I want to go through each one of these. And just make sure that we're kind of meeting all the criteria for an objective, which I think we can do, but these are all specific, which is good. Do you feel these are all achievable? These are things you can do. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Well, someone that knew done in the past, right,  right. So now we have the specific and the achievable. I don't want to get too personal and more tricky, which is making it measurable. I like to do here. I don't want to be overly prescriptive in terms of objectives. I want you to decide. But I want to see We can quantify, in some manner, how often you'll be able to do these different things or how, you know, quite like a homer but to think about the spacing would be the quantity but, but first with the walking. So in a given week, say what's realistic for you in terms of getting out and walking? How many times? Um, maybe I can start out with twice a week, twice quickly. Okay. Do you have two particular days in line days for your responsibilities aren't too great. You have that opportunity? Maybe we need to start with one day a week. Okay. Let's go one day, one time, one time a week. Let's talk with one and then we'll see what happens. Okay,  so what day of the week are you thinking? About Monday? Consider a window of opportunity you see on Monday. It is. Yeah. Plus, it just kind of, I think, no, no. How about Wednesday?  Wednesday? Yes. Wednesday, middle of the week. Stress from work and school and yes, Wednesday. Sounds good. Once you have a particular time range, you like to walk a few times a day, like 6:30. That's a good time for you. As the time you can get out of house, yes, off work. And give me a little bit of time to get home and change and out the door. Because if I, if I make it too late, I'm not going to go 6:30 is kind of a good, that's a good time. Yeah. 630 good. So we'll start with that objective. The Walking Every Wednesday at 630 for every amount of time are comfortable with. So, the homework is a little trickier, right? This is about spacing it out. Okay? So the homework assignments, they're stressing you out. How much time did they take? Last few few questions. How much time do they take to complete? Generally? Like an hour? So it depends on the assignment. If you had the average of the average two hours let's go to worst case, let's go two and a half hours just to cover code worst case will generally be the worst case. Maybe it depends, because when we get three,  yeah, the second two to three hours, okay. And then how much time do you have when it's assigned to when it's due usually Maybe a couple of weeks. A couple weeks. Yeah. I get distracted. So a little distracted. So it's, you know, I start reading and I'll fall asleep or I get distracted by something. And then before you know it, the time is gone. And I'm rushing at the end to get it shown up to try and get it all done. So I was ready to do the work to ease into the last Okay, yeah, I could see how that would be stressful. what day of the week isn't usually a Sunday. On Tuesdays on Tuesdays. So you have Tuesday, and then you have another Tuesday and the week after that, you have three hours of work. And those two weeks. shipping. Okay? Yeah, will be the first day and time but kind of like when you specified Wednesday 630 that's gonna be a walking time, right right at the time, and you can start the homework because the first time I'm come back from my walk on Wednesdays. How long do you foresee Well, normally only half an hour. So to get some time to decompress and round Alright, so from eight to nine on Tuesday, or Wednesday, on Wednesday, you'll get the first third of the homework. And then and then just stop. Okay, that'd be that'd be done for the night. Okay. All right. That's some big plans. How about that second hour? I'll get started. Thursday, so it's just one day apart. Yeah, that's due Thursday. Oh, do come Thursday. Yeah. an hour. Yes. And what hour do you have in mind? Thursday's So but 7070 so one night, Wednesday be at nine o'clock. And then on Thursday, seven nine was two hours. Seven days. Sorry. Okay. So now just the last hour remains Sunday, Sunday through Sunday. Okay. So you you want to get everything done from Tuesday to Sunday night? Yeah, the rest of that time off. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Sure that's achievable. That seems like you're, you're getting a lot in there, but you think you can do it? I can try. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. All right. What time Sunday, Sunday around five to five to six, five to six. Yes. And I'm assuming it won't run over because we kind of have to be on the high side, but if it did, I would be able to go five to seven So that's kind of like, yeah, flexible time there. Yes. So what would that feel like to get your homework done? But it would be a relief. Okay. So, and there's a potential backup plan I see in here is that if something happens on Sunday, where you need more time, and you don't want to stress, you still have that Wednesday after you walk bacon. Yeah. So that could be like your, your backup. Yes, that makes sense. Yes. Because you still have another six days to have done after that. Right. All right. So all those seem realistic and achievable. It does. Every so many Fridays. every friday So, so this is this isn't every Friday commitment. Right, this thing? Yeah. But one Friday is generally it's maybe about two hours, two hours. So two hours every Friday. There's something really enjoyed though. So and it sounds like you look forward to it. Yeah. So Friday, two hours, I guess. Yes. afternoon or evening. Evening. Okay. Yeah, I mean, if I if it was something that came up that I really had to get done is not like I can't not go. So it won't be managed, right? Yeah. Good. Okay. So that was the last objective this is. This is I guess about a whole day commitment, right? Because you go to the beach, it's an hour drive, so you probably wouldn't want to go down for just a few hours. More like the whole day, would they? That would be more like a Saturday. But of course, it wouldn't be every Saturday. So how many times and say a month, like once? Once a month? Okay. So you go down on Saturday morning and come back? Yes. That's something to look forward to. Yes. Is that something that would be okay, in terms of like, because on Friday night, potentially, you'd be out. Right and then Saturday. Yeah, if I, if all those Saturdays that I know that I'm going I could not be out too late on that. Okay, that's a good idea. So you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out? Yes. When you know that Saturday is coming or not go at all, that's fine. Either way, just take a break that time. Yes. Restore. All right. So that's four separate objectives. And what I want to do since I've kind of made a lot of specific notations here, I want to take a moment just take a break, and print this up for you. Okay, we'll work on the rest of your goals next time but I want you to have this so you can get started on it right away. So before I print these up as a changes you want to make um, I would like to try that And if it doesn't work, can we tweak? Oh yeah, we can always make changes. Maybe certain things will work really well. It Certain things, we'll have to take off the list altogether, maybe substitute something else. Yeah, we can, we can make edits to it the whole time you're here. Okay, we can just make a document that changes as as needed. But if you think it's a good starting place, I'll go and print this up as it is, and give you a copy and we can resume with today's session. And then next time I see in a week, or call the rest of the treatment plan. Beside the plan, yes. Thanks, Allison.  Thank you.","The patient has felt a little depressed and wish to reduce those feelings. The patient has been stressing out doing homework and walking has helped them before to give some relief. The therapist clarifies organizing homework differently in small bits will help instead of last minute. The patient enjoys singing as it is a social activity. The patient also loves going to the beach and visiting their aunt. The therapist works out a plan with the patient. The plan is to walk every wednesday at 6:30 for the amount of time they are comfortable with. The patient would take three hours at max to complete their homework. The plan discussed is to do homework on wednesday right after the walk, then on Thursday and Sunday. The patient agrees all those feel realistic and achievable. The patient also adds a two hour plan on Friday evenings which is not every Friday. The therapist finally adds the whole day commitment to drive down to aunt's place once a month on any saturday. The therapist documents this plan and would review in the next session in a week."
20,"Summarize: Am I doing today? I'm doing good thanks. How are you? I'm doing well. Thank you for asking. I understand you've been having some symptoms that have been bothering you lately. Can you? Can you tell me about that? Well, I just moved into an apartment. It's the first time that I'm on my own. And I kind of had heard that someone got robbed and ever since then. I'm kind of nervous about my apartment getting wrong. Someone someone was robbed. near where you live. Yeah. Someone in the same complex. Okay. So Sometimes when I'm sleeping, I'll wake up in the middle of the night, and I'll think that I locked the door. Is the door locked? And I can't fall back asleep. How long does it take you to fall back to sleep? Sometimes it takes maybe an hour two. And what are you thinking about during that time? I'm just worried that I left the door unlocked. And sometimes I'll hear sounds. And I think maybe someone's in the apartment or I just, I get nervous. I just get scared. That sounds scary. And you said a couple hours to stay away. Yeah. So yeah. So this is this is troubling for you. Have you ever gotten up and check the door? Now I sit in bed, and I just try to I just think about it. So you just keep thinking about it. Does it get worse as the time goes on? Or does it get better? What happens? It gets, it gets worse. I mean, I try to fall back asleep, and I stay in bed and I just think, you know, maybe I did leave the door unlocked. And then I just keep thinking that maybe it isn't locked. So keep cycling through the same Yeah. Do you ever do anything to try to get those thoughts to go away like focusing on something else? Um, well, I have like a ceiling fan above me. So sometimes, I'll just like, count how many times it goes around and just to distract myself from thinking about it. But I still think about the door being unlocked. Sometimes it helps. Right? So you have have a fear that somebody is going to enter break in To where you live, and you're staying up at night thinking about whether the doors been secured. That's been that's been troubling. Anything else? Um, sometimes if I'm leaving for work, I'll get to my car and I'll think I let the hair Sugarland. And I'll think to myself, should I go back? I don't know what to do. And I'll just, like, kind of debate whether or not I should just go double check. I'm just worried that if I left the straightener on something, you know, that would happen,  What do you think  happen? Well, I mean, if I left the strainer on something, you know, it's if I have like clothes or something and it's it's on a quad like that burn, or if it's I just don't want anything. I don't want to place the burn down was nervous about. So when you leave, you're thinking about it was a hairspray Are you thinking about whether you unplugged it or not? Or turn it off or not? Yeah. And how long those thoughts go on for? Normally I think about it before I get to my car, and I'm like, well, maybe I should just go just to make sure I unplugged it and I turned it off. And then sometimes during the day, I'll be at work and I can't focus just because I'm thinking about, I'll come back and I'll see you know, my apartment burned down so I left the strainer plugged in. Alright, so remember with the door you're saying that you you struggle with those thoughts, but you don't get up and check the door. Have you ever come back and checked to see if something was left on? No, I haven't. But it just I think about it. I would if I did leave it. If I did leave it on or plugged in. So you're worried anxious Yeah. Yeah, afraid? Yeah, definitely. All three. And how, how often does this happen? Like the cycle of thoughts? Probably throughout the day. So every day? every day, yeah. And how long has this been going on? For Ever since I moved, I guess into the apartment. So about I guess a year  this specific a year yeah. And in that year timeframe hasn't become any worse. Yeah. Yeah. How did it start out? Um, it started out with just, you know, I would go to bed and I would wake up in the light and think to myself tonight, the door I'm pretty sure I locked the door. And then I would just be fine. I could go back to sleep and be like, no, I remember I locked it. But then as it progressed, I really, I would wake up multiple times throughout the night. And I would it would just keep me up. I should as you thought about it. yeah All right, I want to ask a few other questions, try to help me figure out what's going on. Have you ever been diagnosed with any condition like a mental health condition? No Have a medical condition? No, never. Have you ever used alcohol or any other substances? No And is this been the first time in your life you've experienced these symptoms? Starting a year ago up till now? Yeah,  never anything like this before. No I'm going to get you in to see one of our counselors here. okay I appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been helpful for me to try to understand what's going on. Thank you. Thanks","The patient has just moved into an apartment and they are on their own for the first time.

21,"Summarize: How are you? Thanks, how are you? I'm doing well. Thank you for asking. I understand that. You've come here today because you've had some symptoms that have been bothering you. Yeah. I have anxiety sometimes. And I've lost about three jobs within the past year. You've lost three jobs in the past year. Is it because of things? Yeah, well, I'm scared that something's going to happen and my apartment. So I need to unplug things. But I it has to be in order. So when I unplug things, it has to start with the TV and then my computer And then my phone and then the lamps. And then I've been late to work. Alright, so you have a system you go through of unplugging. Yeah, different objects in your apartment. And you're worried that they're going to cause a problem if they're left plugged in. Yeah. Like if they overheat it because they burned it down. You're so afraid that if you leave them plugged in or overheat,  yeah,  and your apartment will catch on fire. And you have a particular order, you go in as you unplug, yeah. What happens if you're unplugging the items and you get distracted or something interrupts that mean sometimes I'll get like a text message and I'll hear my phone call. Have to just start all over again. Will you plug the objects back in? Are we how we do it for the items are already unplugged? I would just have to unplug them, and then I would have to plug them back in or vice versa. I should go back and plug them in? Yeah. What's your anxiety level? Like as you start that process? It's it's really bad. Is it? Yeah. How about towards the end of the process? It goes away. But it it's just kind of temporary for a little bit of time, and then it comes back and I have to go check it again. Okay, so So when it comes back, everything's unplugged. So you have to plug everything back in, unplug it.  Yeah. And go through the whole process again. It's just pretty distressing. Yeah. Yeah. And you think that This is what led to the problems of deployment. Yeah, because I also, I have to lock my door, but I like to lock it 12 times. So I'll put the key in, and I'll hear it click, but then I just like doing it 12 times just to make sure it's locked. And that made me late for work. And then when I was at work, I have a drawer on the cashier. Um, so I would just make sure it was locked, but I would have to do it, you know, 12 times just make sure was locked. And I didn't get back in time to like, half the customers. Sure your employer wasn't wasn't happy with that. Yeah. And that led to those new job. Yeah. you're working now? No, um, I had a job for a little bit of time. It was again a cashier position. But I was on break. And, you know, I was like in the room and I have the fights and I Just Just want to be sure like they would go off all the way because they don't want me to light on. And by the time I got done turning them on, and just make sure they were off and get back in time on the floor. My employer just said I wasn't a good fit wasn't a good fit. So this so these symptoms have caused you some real problems. Yeah. With employment and how about with your anxiety level? My anxiety is really bad. If we were to put on a scale like one was very little exciting. A 10 was the worst anxiety you've ever experienced. What kind of anxiety having a daily basis now? Probably, like a 10 by 10. So the worst ever Yeah. and checking the door was checking light switches, unplugging everything. This reduces your anxiety for a while just for a little bit. But then it comes back? Yeah. Is there anything else that you do that helps to reduce the anxiety? It's just, I guess when I'm in the act of doing it, it will relieve it. And that'll be okay for a little bit of time. But even coming in, you know, like I said, when you have chairs and some pictures, and I just like I had to touch them, like, had to touch the chairs. But I wanted to touch the chairs first, and then the pitchers. And that's normally what I do. I'm in a room like I have to touch the chairs first. And I feel okay when I'm doing it. And then when I'm finished, I feel a little better. But then it comes back things. Do you know how long you've had these symptoms? Probably since, I guess like third grade. So So sometime Yeah. Did they start off? Like they are now? Or are they different? And started off with a little bit of things like I would just get a little bit of anxiety. I just went on to play with the doorknob. And then as I got it went away for like a year. Maybe and then I would start to play with the lights and just make sure that they were off. It was the same thing that help reduce anxiety. Yeah. didn't cause any trouble? My parents didn't really like it. They kind of were like, you know, something's wrong with you. Yeah. Stop playing with that. Will you ever taken somewhere and diagnosed or treated? No, no. My parents just thought it was like nerves. And now it's now it's the worst it's ever been. Yeah. Yeah. Do you feel like you're able to go back to work with the symptoms? Boy they are now? Probably not. Because they're so disruptive. Yeah. Have you ever had any medical conditions? No. And have you ever used or do use a types of a type of drug or alcohol. No And I want to thank you for coming. I'm going to get you scheduled to see one of our counselors. I appreciate you spending time with me. It's helped me to understand what you're going through. Thank you. Thanks.","The patient feels anxious and feel something is going to happen in their apartment. The patient feels the need to unplug things. They fear it might overheat and burn the place down.

They patient also locks door 12 times to ensure it is locked. The patient has performed poorly at job due to this habit.

23,"Summarize: Erica, how you doing today?  Good. Thank you. You're doing good? between part of me that wants to settle down, but then part of me that also wants to pursue my career and what I'm doing so we have a part that wants to settle down, a part that wants to keep going with the career so For this to chair, what I like to do is in the chair where you're seated now, this will be the emotional self, in this case, the side that wants to pursue the career. Yeah, myself before that seems like we're more that's what I really want. Yes, you're more emotionally connected. That's what you want. That's what I want. So this will be the side of you, that has the needs and the wants, and more the emotion. Okay, so that's who you'll be in this chair. That makes sense.  Yep.  In the other chair, let's have the critic that's inside that internal critic. That's advocating for settling down for getting married for having kids. In a way it represents a societal pressure Did those two sides seem separate to you?  Yeah.  You feel like you can be the emotional self here, an internal critic there? I think so. Okay. So, I think you remember how this work she'll be, he'll be talking to this case the internal critic, right? So the internal critics on the side of settling down, getting married. And then when you're ready to have the critic respond, you'll switch that chair and respond to the emotional needs driven and wanting some make sense. Okay. So whenever you're ready, go ahead and speak directly to the internal critic. I want to Finish what I'm doing, and I want to finish what I started. I've worked so hard on my career path, and I'm so close to finishing. And I want to finish for me want to accomplish those goals that I've set for myself? And something I'm passionate about? So you've made your statement. Are you ready to switch? Okay, good switch. So I use the internal critic. There's always time to pursue a career, but I need to focus on what's expected of me at this time, on the best age for having kids I have a loving boyfriend who is ready and wants to get married and settle down. And you are being selfish by just following a path that you can take at any time an internal critic cues in the emotional side, in this case, the career side, been selfish. And notice your posture is very linear and you're upright. I noticed you kind of put your hand down a little bit when you're talking. Try to think of the internal critics, body movements. Try to act that out a little bit. Okay. Think it's accusation. You know, I think I like I just wanted to, like tell the emotional part that it's being stupid that it's, you know, you're you're you're not acting in the best interest of everyone else. Jump at it. You're gonna jump at the emotional side? Yeah. So that's the internal critic, they respond back to the term critic from the emotional side.  Yeah,  okay. So the internal critic is just called a selfish and one of the things is a response. I feel like I'm being attacked. And I don't think it's wrong to think about myself and what I am truly passionate about. Let me interrupt you. So your hands are pointing back toward the career emotional self. What can you do with your hands that really embody that you want to communicate to the internal critic? Is there anything else you want to do? the pointing towards me to protect myself from what the critics is saying. I just want to like push that back towards critic. So continueand have used that motion there. You're, you're pushing the internal critic away. Okay. So I don't need I don't need to feel guilty you know, I don't need to feel selfish for wanting to follow my dreams does the internal critic have something to say back? No. So you've you've now pushed the emotional side is pushed the critical way. Okay. I think the critic, the critic feels like it understands where the emotional side of me is coming from. You know, like I can recognize why it's so important, then, like why working so hard is, is worth that, you know, sense of accomplishment that's going to come with it, how it's gonna, in the long run, help provide for all these extra things that I want to like my family in the future. I can see that. Alright, so internal critic is that hands down here is the internal critic. Right? It's an internal critic less angry, less assertive, less pushy, less pushy, less pushy. Yeah, it's not. Not as critical. Truthfully, it's just I feel like the the pressure is annoying Dwayne on either either shoulders So the critic is more separated now maybe a little bit but also has a different outlook. more quiet. It's not like always yelling at me. Because I think it I mean, sometimes it might still say something but not in like the urgency that it had before. So the critic has lost some of its vigor and determination. Yeah,  to move back to the emotional? I feel calmer. I feel like you know, the critic is, has always been a part of me. But that part of me It's more like, you know, it's it's not as assertive. It's not as you know, intense right now it's a call. And I think that the emotional part of me was able to win the argument per se, you know, just because that's, you know, what I want. So at the end of this conflict, after we split into two parts here, they have this conflict is eventually a decision is a decision to pursue a career or settle down. Do you feel you gain more clarity in that decision? Yeah. Because I feel like I, you know, I can stay on my decision is in has, you know, has been to stay on my career path, but now I feel less guilty for doing it. So that's, that's really been your decision all along. But the internal critic was harassing you this whole time?  Yes. And today you're able to kind of shove that internal critic back a little. And allow that internal critic to see how strongly you feel with the decision you've made. Yeah, that I very much do you feel is helpful technique? Yeah, I do. I, you know, I think that separating the two sides helped me realize which one felt stronger. So he was able to give you some clarity. Yes. Right. All right. Well, let's once reflect on what's happened here, between now and the next session, okay, Bye, guys. Kind of a lot happened. And it seems like you've gained clarity for your decision. And then we'll pick up with the next session and see how things have progressed with. See if that internal critic is still harassing you or if it kind of stays back. And if you have more peace with a decision, that's not like a plan.","A part of the patient wishes to settle down, but they also wish to pursue their career. The therapist suggests to do a role-play with internal critics to settling down on one side and responding for their emotional needs on the other side. The patient acting as critic is accused of being selfish and the critic responds that the emotional side is being stupid and it is not acting in the best interest of everyone. The patient feels attacked and they wish to protect themselves from what the critic is saying. The patient feels the critic understands the emotional side and seems less assertive. The patient feels calmer. The patient has some clarity after enacting that they wish to pursue a career or settle down. Role-play has helped the patient realize which side they felt stronger. The therapist confirms to pick this up in the next session and have a check if the patient's internal critic is still harassing the patient. "

26,"Summarize: I saw the thing that your name is Elizabeth, and I'm not sure if that's what you go by,  I mean, Liz would be the best.  All right, great. So this one of the things I wanted to talk with you about is I know that you did some assessments over the last couple of days. And so I want to talk with you about that and just talk with you about kind of treatment and how things are going to go. And based on that sounds like the what, from what you were saying in terms of the assessment process that you have an eating disorder, it's called bulimia nervosa, and I'm not sure if you've ever heard of that. I mean, a little bit yeah. Okay. So what I want to do is kind of describe that for you a little bit. So what you talked about was that there are periods of time when you have when you have eating episodes where you eat, like kind of a large amount of food that you feel like that you've lost control and you feel, you know, like overly full me vomit and the This happens fairly regularly. And there are times to when you, you know, you're maybe really overly concerned about your shape or your weight. And that feel familiar to you. Yeah. So and then it sounds like that's been going on for quite some time, at least, you know, two, three, sometimes even upwards of five times a week. I, I'd say, Yeah. All right. So just want to let you know to about, about that, that it's not unusual. For a person like in college like yourself to be struggling with an eating disorder like this. In fact, we see upwards of 5% of women and call on college campuses who struggle with that and even more upwards of 20%, who have you know, kind of what we would call kind of variants of that in terms of excessive dieting, and some may even like, throw up or use laxatives or excessively exercise, so it's not unusual. One of the things we know about blaming Nervosa is that for a lot of women, it really starts by Excessive dieting. So like going for long periods of time without eating and sounds like that that was something that you endorsed as well that there are times when you kind of diet excessively. Yeah, especially when I was younger. One of the things that we know about bulimia nervosa is that when people overly restrict or you know, stop eating a lot or go for, you know, a day and a half and really restrict their calories, that oftentimes that that kind of leads into that kind of binge eating cycle. And we know that that's the case. The other thing that we're aware of is that a lot of individuals who struggle with eating difficulties like this also report a lot of difficulties they have like with managing stress or managing relationships or have a difficult time knowing what they're feeling or managing feelings. Is that something that you've experienced? Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, that's okay. Because in many respects, I think both things go on for individuals that struggle with eating difficulties like that. And so we know that there's a lot of dieting and restriction that goes on but we also know that there are other things that are happening in terms of managing feelings, managing stress, etc. So one of the things that I like to focus on in terms of working with clients and working with individuals like yourself is I take an approach it's called interpersonal psychotherapy and, and what that means, in essence is that I like to approach the eating problem by looking at kind of the kind of social in kind of more interpersonal context, because there's a lot of things that are probably going on, or may have gone on in your life that have been kind of associated with times and you've been more likely to use food or to restrict your calorie intake. And so what I'd like to do is really talk with you over the next, you know, few sessions about, you know, periods of time in your life currently and in the past where you've had, you know, overeating episodes and when you've restricted your calories, when you've You know, lost weight, or when you, you know binge and things like that and really start looking at, you know, patterns perhaps in your relationships and then what we'll do is kind of sum that up at the end of the time that we're together and see if we can kind of come up with a little bit of a game plan and some goals to help you reduce your binge eating. So how's that sound? Okay. And there's really good evidence for the things you know, the things that we're going to be doing, in fact, the more that we work on some of these issues, you'll you'll know pretty quickly that you're gonna start feeling a lot better and, and it'll have a, you know, pretty positive impact on your eating. Okay, great. So this is what I'd like to do is first of all, first of all, let's start with I want you to give me a recent episode, where like just recently within the last couple days where you've had one of those episodes that you talked about where you felt like a lot that you lost control, and that you ended up vomiting or you know, and and it will and kind of get an idea about that. And then what I'd like to do is and we'll go kind of back in time, and then I want you to tell me the first time that you had an episode like that. So and then then what we'll do then over the next couple of sessions is then we'll, we'll start from when it started and kind of like work our way up to the present. And I'll just ask you a lot of questions and we'll, you know, kind of go from there. Right? So why don't you tell me the Tell me like a recent episode, that where you felt like that you'd lost control. You're eating me like just this Saturday night, I guess. I went out with my friends. And it was fun. It was a good night at first and whatnot. And we then went to a party. I guess guess what kind of sparked it would be I saw the sky that I kind of liked for a little while and I mean, I just wasn't I was a little nervous about kind of what I was wearing and it just didn't feel that good to see him. So I kind of left pretty early on and went home or back to my apartment. And yeah, I mean, kind of what typically happens is the kitchen grabbing different foods bag of chips. I think my roommate had left out like a sleeve of cookies or something and, and I just ate on the couch. Yeah. Finished most of it and yeah. Okay. Did you been restricting your your food? You know, for the prior to that or you've been dieting prior to that? I mean, I guess like, dieting isn't what you would consider it as I try to eat more healthy typically. And yeah, I mean, I've been like dealing with different assignments and stress around that. So Yeah, it's kind of fluctuated time. Okay. Okay. I'm meant to tell you to I like to take a lot of notes at least initially so I have a good sense of what's going on. So what else was going on? Okay, so it sounds like Saturday night out with friends. See person that you like that you've just say you dated some? I really like we've kind of been like okay interested. Interesting. Yeah. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. Okay, so you're kind of interested. Yeah. And then you sounds like what you were, then you began to feel more concerned about how you were how you looked at how your outfit felt. Yeah. I mean, I didn't plan on seeing him right now. Yeah, yeah, it just, it was Yeah, the right outfit to see. Okay. And so that then, then what's then what happened then is that you go back to the apartment foods there. And then you kind of sat down on the couch and you felt like that you'd lost control. Yeah. And then I guess after that, like before bed I made sure. Okay. Go into the bathroom. Okay. Okay. It's just kind of a typical scenario. Yeah. I mean, yeah, eating before. Okay. Okay. And then um, so you went home to the apartment. your junior year. So my third year in school, and what are you working on? at English isn't major? Yeah. Because I was thinking about the time of the year, so Coming up or any projects coming up, so, anything big on the horizon for you?  I mean, like midterm, okay. Okay. Okay. Ah, yes, studying for one of my midterms and like on Thursday night, my test was on Friday, and my roommate kind of has had her boyfriend over a lot. And it's pretty annoying because like she knew I had a test to study for and, like, I like being home to study. I don't want to, I don't want to be in the library. Like, I want to be in my room and my bed and they're constantly in the living room on the couch. And yeah, they're pretty loud. So it's kind of frustrating and yeah, it's pretty stressful. Okay, sounds like it. Um, what's your roommates name?  Kathy Kathy. Okay. Okay. So then Kathy has a roommate over quite often this last week she was they were there quite a bit boyfriend, her boyfriend. Okay. And then you're trying to study and did you talk with them about that in terms of the noise or that bothering you? I mean, she knew I had a midterm coming up. Okay. Okay. Sounds like you feel like that you've tried to let her know in various ways that you know, you've got something coming up and that you'd like to study and when it's quiet and you'd like to be able to focus but that the sounds like that. They're kind of constant commotion is really distressing to you, right? If you talk with her, like one to one about How that bothers you or that that's a real problem for you. Okay, she know what's hard about doing that, in terms of talking with her. I mean, we're kind of like newer roommates, each other we were introduced. So we haven't known each other. Okay. All right, that makes sense. Okay. I mean, he's ever alive. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay, that's helpful. Yes, middle school, so or eighth grade, probably 12 or 13? Middle School, 12 or 13 years old. Um, good. So we'll start from there. Tell me about your. Tell me about your parents. So my mom, Lisa, she, my dad is Steve. They actually got divorced when I was 10. Okay, so she then remarried soon after. Okay. Okay, so your mom and dad divorced when you were 10. Okay, and so, alright, so let me Okay, that's helpful. And then you say your mom got remarried. Two years after that. Okay. Okay. You haven't any siblings? I do now from this from her second marriage. Okay. All right. And is that a boy or a little sister? What's her name? Brooke. Okay, so mom remarried. What's your stepdad same? Bruce. Bruce. Okay. Okay. All right. So, Mom and Bruce. They have a little girl and her name is Brooke. Okay, how old is Brooke. Okay, six. Oh, she's six. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. I mean, like after, or what led up to that kind of do you have a sense about what led up to the divorce or what was going on? I guess they were fighting a lot. Yeah, probably that those are probably my most memorable memories. Yeah, that's a fighting and dad, just they weren't around each other as much anymore. And mom was kind of out of the house more. Okay. Then Then. So then they divorced when you were 10. And so then how soon after, did your mom marry a Bruce? just under two years under two years. Okay. How was that for you to have her remarry so quickly? I mean, they really like it. Yeah. Okay. During the, during that period of time, because I know you talked about middle school, but during the period of time when they were having difficulties with their marriage. What was your, you know, your eating like? or How are you managing that during that time in terms of your feelings about the night? Ah. I mean, I guess I don't really recognize too many issues right then necessarily. Were you talking to anybody or you know, anybody? reasonable. Did anybody else know what was going on? Or? I mean, I was like, pretty close with my grandma, my dad's mom. Okay. And she was aware of what was happening. Yeah, she was. Yeah. So she was definitely there. Okay, I'm closer with my dad. I'd say. Okay, even at that time, and sounds like that. You're pretty close to you're pretty close to your dad's mom. Yeah. She's not around anymore. But yeah. Oh, I'm sorry about that. When did she pass away High School. Okay, so alright, so make a note of that okay all right so yeah definitely make sure that we talk a little bit about that okay so at 10 mom and dad divorce less than two years your Mamrie Mary's Mary's Bruce so then what happened what happened to you after the divorce Did you were you with your dad with with you know with my mom more we moved to a different area okay not too far from my dad I saw him like a decent amount but definitely was with my mom more okay so then you alright so then Bruce your mom and Bruce in the you because I know you're seeing more time with her moved to what like a different different town different I just like a town over okay, but change schools and whatnot. Okay. All right. So prior to moving to a new school, were you in a public school or private school isn't a public school, then switch to a private switch or private school? Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. How was that transition for you going from public school to private school? I mean, I wasn't excited about it. It was kind of like a more uppity area. Yeah, I mean, like, it was kind of hard, because they're like, like in a private school, these people have kind of been together for a little while. And because there's less people there, they kind of moreso all know each other and have their groups and whatnot. Okay. And so then that would have been in around the time when you were 1213 when you made that move. Okay, so then, sounds like to that that was the time when you first were aware of struggling with your eating. Yeah, I think I like started. Mate, and I felt like more pressure from my mom. She was very vocal. towards me about my eating and my looks and whatnot. Oh, that you felt when you say pressure from her In what way? Were she pressuring you? I mean, like she wanted me to look good. Okay. Like what say that you would fit in more or okay. Okay, okay doing hair. Yeah. Okay. And it sounds like what you were saying was that we'll ask you how you felt. And you said you You said you weren't excited. You weren't excited. Like I wasn't excited, but so doesn't mean so did that mean that you weren't sounds like if you weren't happy? happy let them know that I didn't like the school. Okay. And then what when you would do that what would be the risk I just like, oh, you should feel lucky. Like it's good school. Okay. Okay. Well, so many ways, like, one might be putting words your mouth, but what like, kind of get over it or like deal with it or, okay. So and so then you were feeling pressure from her sounds like also to that you weren't really feeling like that they were really that maybe there wasn't as much concern about your feelings about where you were. Was there anything specifically that your mom would say to you about that in terms of like, kind of the Get over it? You know that? I mean, you mean in terms of the schooler? My body? No, you're in terms of the school. I mean, like get over it, like, it will get better with time. Like you just have to put yourself out there to meet people. Okay. All right. So, that kind of pressure. Yeah. And then you said that you didn't really like Bruce, what kind of person was a man? What was making you not like him so well? I mean, he's just kind of like a sketchy guy. Okay. Oh, so that maybe that there was something going on between Bruce and your mom prior to the divorce? Yeah. Sorry to hear that must have been really hard. Yeah. And were you keeping in touch with your dad during that time? Yeah. Okay. Like, were you? I mean, how what was the arrangement where you're spending time with him sometimes and spending time with your mom? Yeah. So I said my mom during the week and I got to my dad like every other week. Okay. Okay. So then, given the fact that in case you weren't happy in school, you said that it was more kind of an uppity school, private school. Kids Was it a mixed school or was it like an all girls school? Yeah, mix school and that kind of clicky sounds like and then your mom really sounds like she really was pressuring you really wanted to try to pressure you so that you fit in a little bit better. So when in this process Did you find yourself like like turning to food or being excessively concerned about your weight or starting to diet binge things like dieting, it's definitely I guess, like eighth grade, ninth grade. And that definitely came from like, my mom thinking were telling me that to look a certain way to knit Yeah, and then there were times like, like there was unhealthy food around the hospital debris seats. Mm hmm. And is there an accessible at times like I would eat that I would say for the most part, I would try to like really restrict myself to Okay. Okay. And do you recall the first time that you then vomited or use vomiting as a way to kind of like manage the overeating? I mean, just like pressures of starting High School, and I'm in a same school, same people and I really wasn't happy, hard to make friends. I don't know When I guess I heard from some of the other girls about, like vomiting as like an option, right, that they've heard some of their friends talk about before. Right? Right. Yeah, so, okay. And like the dieting even though if I was eating healthy, I would still hear from my mom like, oh, like you need to look like this, right? Here's this outfit I want you to wear, but you can't wear it like if your body's like that. So she was really critical of how you looked. Okay, okay, so then what was that? What did that do? Let me take a step back. So it sounds like that. You've always been a little closer to your dad. So then what was the divorce and the move and some of that transition? What effect did that have on your relationship with your mom? I mean, I don't even really remember like a really good time with my mom. Okay. Okay. All right. So the two of you don't get along as well. Okay. Did it was it getting? Was it kind of the same during that time? Or was it getting worse? I mean, I guess I was getting more vocal towards her and speaking my mind more. Okay. All right. And then she was then coming back more harshly and more critically. Okay. All right. Okay. Well, it's not unusual. I mean, a couple things, certainly not unusual for, you know, girls at that age, you know, in terms of like, kind of the social influence or kind of the social contagion of, you know, with eating and diet, you know, binge eating and dieting and vomiting. So it sounds like that, that was kind of, in some respects part of that culture. But it also sounds like that there, you know, in terms of the external pressure that you were getting from your mom to look a particular way. It almost sounded like that, that she was saying that you were like, What? You were too heavy for a particular outfit. And so then, I'm sure that that Do you remember how that was feeling to you at that time when she would say things like that? Today? Yeah, I felt like nothing I could do. Right. Right. Yeah. All right cut of Trump. Did you talk to anybody about that? Did you talk with your dad about that? Or? It's like, No, not really. Okay. We have. Okay. So you kept a lot of those feelings to yourself. Okay. All right. Okay, well, that's that's, that's helpful. Let's kind of let's kind of hang on to that, because we've got a couple things because obviously, I think the the divorce the move the transition from middle school to high school. Also sounds though that also during that time that you're obviously you didn't have a very good relationship with Bruce to begin with. And that your relationship with your mom was kind of deteriorating. Yeah. And then I know you said your grandmother passed away when you were in, in high school, but during that time, like, you know, eighth or ninth grade, did you have more contact with her? Were you able to, like connect with her on that as much as I could? She also I mean, she didn't live in That's where I was living. Like when I would see my dad like occasionally we got, okay, okay. Okay, um, I mean, like I love, we're really close and I love her. But as well as training so as an only child and then your mom gets remarried and soon after a new baby And others also like, my mom and stepdad, like they both worked a lot. And so there's also like, I was kind of looking after Brooke, got Okay. Okay. Okay, so then, right? So not only did Where's your relationship with your mom kind of deteriorating, then all of a sudden, she's pregnant, she delivers. You have a baby sister. They're working. And now not only are you kind of feeling distressed about your relationship with her, but now you're also feeling the pressure to take care of a baby sister. Okay. Okay, and so, during that time, you're feeling what? Ah, I just have, you know, a lot of weight on my okay. emotional weight on your shoulders. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then and then what was your eat so then that would have been like, you know, the years like 14 maybe to 16 when you were more active. involved with that. What was your eating? Like during that time? I mean, I guess kind of similar to, like what I described, kind of now. I mean, I like try to eat like super healthy, right? But then at times, like, especially because there was food available. So were you binge eating more during that time then? Yeah, and I mean, because I kind of found other ways to make up for the binge eating. Okay. All right, such as throwing up, so vomiting. Okay, so then that, that kind of began to that started during that particular time. Okay. All right. That's, yeah. Okay. That's really helpful to get that. Um, I mean, I guess I try to keep in touch with friends from my old school is tough because they all have new friends. And I've met a few people. Like, nothing I know and I really open to but I mean, I have a couple friends.  Okay, um, did anybody get anybody like emerges like, like a best friend or a really good friend during that time or? I mean, I just went to my friends from like when I was really young. Okay, and what's her name? is Julia. Julia. Okay. So do you enjoy? Did you enjoy and still kind of maintain contact during the time? Yeah. Yeah. Did Julia know what was going on with you? Are you Did you ever talk with her about kind of like the stress you were under? Like she knew I didn't like my stepdad and that Brooke being born right. So if she was one person that you could kind of confide in a little bit. Did she know about your the struggles you're having with your ex With your binge eating no likes. Okay, yeah, like we never really talked about it. Okay. And you're like she knew, like my mom, like put a lot of pressure. Okay. All right. Okay, that's helpful. So, so Julia was and then kind of a source of support for you during that time. And also sounds like your grandmother was but then you'd also mentioned early on that your grandmother died in high school. Okay, and so that when did she pass away? Okay, when you were 16 Okay. What was that like for you when she died? Yes. Yeah, I mean, a lot. And then, like, my mom, for some reason, didn't want me to go to the funeral. Like, I don't even know why, um, because she doesn't like me being like so connected to my dad's family.  I'm sorry about that. Yeah. So there is kind of like an argument there. About Going to the funeral and they had my dad get involved. And so did you, were you able to eventually go? Okay. All right. give me even more just been like the fight with my mom. Okay. All right. So during that time when you were arguing, you notice more, okay. All right. Okay. All right. So, okay, that's helpful. I mean, that was well, actually seen before that my mom and Bruce actually also got divorce. Oh, okay, so alright, so then as I got like 17 surprised the, like, middle of senior year. Okay, so in the middle of your senior year, then your mom and Bruce get divorced. Okay. All right, so 17 mom and first divorce. Okay, what was that time like for you? Because then obviously then Brooke is then she's about two years old, right? No, no, no, she before. Okay, she's four years old. Okay. Okay. So what was going on? I mean, I never really got close to Bruce. But I would say the only hard part would have been like, kind of figuring out with broke because I was really, I mean, I feel like I raised her. Yeah, that's tough. And it's just like frustrating that like my mom off my dad and then get married and then divorced dad, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so then what did that do to your How did that impact your relationship with your mom after you know in around the divorce? I mean, we were still arguing. Okay a lot. Okay. All right. She like kind of like started like trying to say sorry, like, feeling bad for certain things, but like, it was not again it feel like it was sincere. Okay, so it's almost as though that No, she didn't have anybody and she was you felt like that. She was kind of like trying to reach out to you, like Mike almost like too little too late or, okay. So then, you know continued sounds like continued kind of like anger and frustration with her. And then did did you notice any changes in your eating during that time? I mean as excited hard to leave rock, but like definitely excited to get out of the house like really tremendous thing. something new. Okay. Yeah, it's good.","From the assessment process, it says the patient has an eating disorder called bulimia nervosa.

All right, how about kind of same question except for mental health conditions. I'm just crazy. Like my mom was crazy and she was just completely You have any formal diagnosis she had her um she uses magnetic like I guess like bipolar, but we she never really got like a definitive label as dipole bipolar and like therapy or anything like that. But you know, symptoms of bipolar and anxiety. Yeah. No, that's just my mom with her. You know obsessiveness and she'd get depressed after But as far as any other siblings No, no. Do you have any special family traditions? I mean, we would go on family vacations. When I was a kid. We were constantly staying at the best hotels and stuff like that. Because a mom, you know, would shop around, she actually would Book Three hotels, and just decide which one she liked better when we got there. I don't, I don't know. But anyway, we would do that we would go on vacations together, we would always go down to the beach. So that was really our family tradition as far as in like holidays. We did when we were younger. We would have like our family over for Christmas and stuff like that. But can you tell me about holidays, like were the most important holidays to your family. I Christmas was yester During the most important Thanksgiving,  how did you celebrate those holidays?

28,"Summarize: I appreciate your participation in tech so far. I want to change to new section. That's okay with you. And this section is on substance use. Is that an area you feel comfortable discussing? Sure.  So, are there any substances that you currently use? I drink a bit. Can you tell me how often you drink? I guess it's it's more than a bit. I would say. I have probably three drinks today. And what are you drinking? beer To know what size the bottle says there's there's 3 three bottles of beer a day. Yeah. And how much time does To take you to consumers, Hardly a couple of hours. So, every day, three beers and about two hours. Yeah. Does that do anything to you? In terms of your mood or feeling? Hmm, it just kind of helps me unwind after a long day of work relaxes me. So it's relaxing for you. Yeah. Has it ever gotten you into any type of trouble? Hmm, there is a one time that I, my my friends and I kind of gotten to fight after I had been drinking. And we almost stopped talking because of it, but we were able to work it out. But I almost lost friends ever before. All right, is there any other areas where it might disrupt functioning? Sometimes it's hard to get up and get to work the next morning After I've had, if I drink it like later in the day, it's hard to get up and get to work on time the next morning. So I've been late a couple times. So, three, three bottles of beer, pretty much every day, pretty much every day, whichever is the time when you've consumed more or less than particular day.  And not typically during the week, but sometimes I'll drink more on the weekends. And how long have you been drinking alcohol? I guess I started when I was around 17. Yeah. Was that you mentioned beer. Have you ever consumed any other type of alcohol I've tried wine and shots before but I always kind of just gravity more towards the beer back toward beer. Yeah. Any other substances you use currently on on the weekends as well all all smoke some pot with my friends like Saturday night, When did you first start using marijuana? That was probably a couple years ago when I first started college about two years ago. Yeah. On the weekends, sometimes other times Yeah. mostly on the weekends, occasionally during the week. Has it ever led to any trouble or change the function?  I am not, I mean, on the weekends, no, because I don't really have anywhere to be. But sometimes during the week if I, if I again, kind of like the alcohol if I smoke it too late again, it's hard to get up in the morning and get to work on time and my boss is really starting to get irritated with me how often I've been late. Not that I'm like, super late, but I'm late enough. Have you ever tried to cut down on the substance use? Um, I've tried to cut back on the alcohol before. That a year ago I try. I was, like, started when I started this job that I have now. I tried to cut back when I first started. And I was able to get down to like two, one or two beers instead of three. But then the job got stressful and I got comfortable, I guess and started drinking more again. So you think perhaps the alcohol use is connected to the stress with your job? I yeah, I would say it's definitely connected. Have you ever been annoyed by people that perhaps criticize your substance use? Yeah, my family can be critical of they don't really know about the marijuana but they can be critical of my alcohol use. That bothers you. Yeah. Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your substance use? Right. I felt guilty. Was my mom because it upsets her so much sometimes, like I'll feel guilty about how my son has to be upsets her but and sometimes I feel bad like if I have a fight with my friends if I'm not calm I'll feel bad the next day about getting into an argument with them cuz usually over something silly Have you ever had to drink or use drugs first thing in the morning to study your nerves or to lessen the effects of the hangover? Um, I'd say on the non during the week but on the weekends when I'll drink a little bit more sometimes I'll have like, just a little bit like if I drink Saturday night have a little bit Sunday morning to get going. So on occasion that happens. Yeah, I wouldn't say it's often but on occasion. So, Alcohol, Marijuana, two substances you currently use. Can you tell me about substances used in the past? I'm at a party one time I tried ecstasy but I didn't like it. I ended up not really hanging out with those people anymore. So it wasn't an issue just the one time. Yeah, just the one time.

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Yeah. Were you ever diagnosed with that? Stick around long enough How long did we treat it by the psychiatrists?

31,"Summarize: Okay, I want to switch gears. Again, I want to talk about risk, like suicide or harming others.  Okay I know all these things don't apply to everybody, but I'm gonna make sure I go through and ask certain questions that Okay,  okay. Have you ever had a suicide attempt? NO. So no attempts I've ever had thoughts of suicide. I mean, sometimes when I get really sad, I thought think that the world would be better without me. But I bring myself out of that. I don't think it's anything I'd never do but that's all you ever do. But sometimes, yeah, the thought crosses your mind like that. Yeah, remember the last time I thought like that crossed your mind? We were getting evicted from our last place. Cuz I just felt like a complete failure. How long ago was that? was about a month and a half ago? Yeah, all the my friends in the house turned against me because I couldn't pay rent. And it would have been like, the third month but like not consecutively, so I don't see the big issue. Um, and so they told me that if I didn't get out, they would call the police. And I had to stay with my sister and I just, I felt like a failure. I felt like a failure and myself to my kids. So it's a tough time for you. Yeah. So you had some sounds like maybe passing thoughts. Yeah. that ever changes would you tell me? Yeah So how about harm to others? Meaning Do you ever feel like you have good thoughts? Have you ever develop a plan to hurt someone else? When I was younger not anymore What was the last time probably when I was in high school well but yeah when I was still in that like violent stage in my life where I would fight but I never went to anything like out kill this person. It was always just you know, I'll knock you out, but I won't kill you. And that was a while ago, but presently no thoughts of harming anybody else. No, if I ever feel really, really angry, because held onto a wall I have like special plates. That all thrown on the ground and break them like the suicidal thoughts if thoughts of harming others do come up would you tell me about those? Oh yeah, I don't want to go jail over hurting somebody. So I tell you  Thank you No, no. How about under the influence of drugs? Ah well when I used to do go cocaine sometimes I would like think that somebody is at the door and they're not at the door. Nobody's nobody's there. think somebody in the house when there's nobody in the house? Alright, so I want to switch gears again. I want to talk about if you're okay with this, the goals for counseling, okay? So the goals that you want to meet Okay,  so let's start with if you're okay if your goals in life in general that's I haven't really felt lunch about it, but I would like to just have a real I mean, it doesn't care. I don't care what the job is just a nice cushy job without a job where I can just relax and when my kids will have a good future. I'll have a good future. better future for your children. Oh yeah, Have any other general life goals? I guess be drug free Like I said, I'd really like to quit.  But I have a goal specifically for counseling, like what you hope to get out of this counseling? I'd like to learn to be less angry. Blood pressure down a little bit. eat less? And again, guess try to quit. Quit drugs, quitting drugs. kind of, I guess isn't the answer. To answer, kind of kind of confident, yeah, I mean, like I said, I haven't really move forward anywhere. And every time I go to a counseling place, so Alright, so you're kind of confident and wanting to try again. Yeah. So, throughout this intake of Sq, a lot of questions, I want to thank you for answering them. Do you have any questions for me? No. So next time, I see you, sorry, if you would be about a week. And we'll start with the actual counseling sessions. And so I'll still have some questions, but not as many as I've asked today.  Okay. Does that make sense how it's structured Yeah Alright, so we've completed intake. Also some more questions, but we'll get to the Catholics, the counseling sessions. Next week, we'll get started working on specific details of what's happened to and what might be causing it, how we can treat it.  Alright. So I appreciate again, you taking this time and answer these questions, and I'll see you next week.  Thank you. Thanks, Rhonda.","The therapist discusses suicide with the patient.

32,"Summarize: All right, let's How are you?  Good, good.  It's good to see you. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, good week with the roommates. I had a good conversation with her about like, what times are good for boyfriend to be over and kind of giving him better heads up on when I'm really mean. Silence. Terrific. So what was what specifically? I mean, I know we've talked a lot about that, but what specifically did you say to her, or how did you bring it up is just telling her that like, my studies are really important and I understand like, it's also important that she time with her boyfriend, but that I would really appreciate that this is both our space and that there are times when like, we really need to respect each other's space. And yeah, she responded really well. Yeah, she was like, just really give me a good heads up before. Terrific. You. Yeah. And that we kind of decided like certain times are more appropriate for them to have the living room and not right. Right. Right. Because I think that's really similar No, we kind of talked about that. Because I remember like a few sessions ago, I was kind of wondering whether or not she really got it in terms of what you were feeling because it seems like one of the ways that you've we talked about that before in terms of like, you know, first starting that oftentimes one of the ways that you manage your feelings that you kind of you think you're letting people know what you're you know, feeling but it doesn't really come out. And I know that it's something that you and I had to really like you know, kind of work out but sounds like that. You were able to talk with her in that She heard you. And as I want, as I kind of thought that she was actually really responsive in a very positive way. So I think being a little way direct was helpful. It's really nice, I think to you've been able to do that more with me, and I feel like that, that I feel like it's been really helpful. I know, they've been kind of pushing you on that. And that's been hard, but I feel like it's been really nice to feel like it's really been helpful with your relationship with Kathy. So that's fantastic. And also, you know, again, I know that I've keep, you know, like saying this over and over again. But you know, as you've worked on these things, it's been really notable that it's really had a nice positive effect on your eating because it seems like it's really you've really seen a lot of real nice improvements. So awesome. Anything else that you know, so you had a really good conversation with Kathy, anything else go on this week? Yeah, I got to spend some time with Brooke. At home for two days, and it was with my mom and Okay, okay. So she's still sixers. Did she have a birthday recently? He's awesome. Oh, that's great. almost seven great. You plans for birthday for her or what are you She really into frozen? Okay? Like anything frozen. Okay, okay, okay. Yes. Okay, that sounds terrific. And so then you spend some time with her. So obviously that was real positive for you. Did you? When you were there? Did you have any opportunity to, you know, visit with your mom? or How did that go? I I think my mom was around like we kind of all spent time together. And like she asked about school. They were like, tell her a little more about school and how things are going. Yeah, we don't really get a one on one time. How does it feel for you in terms of like for her? I know you've talked about not really liking that. She all the sudden, is deciding now that she wants to really be kind of like, you know, the good mother and kind of like be involved in your life. But how is it for her to kind of like want to want to know how things have been going for you. I mean, I've kind of like allowed myself to tell her I guess I don't think have been going. I mean, like, to an extent, like it was like it broke and whatnot like we don't really sit down just do together. So kind of what we had discussed kind of that you've been, you've like, you've been allowing yourself to be more connected with her, but you're still kind of keeping up keeping a little bit of a boundary. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm sure that would be really hard to trust her after everything that's gone on, you know, with, you know, kind of the infidelity issue with your dad, or at least it's just, you know, kind of like the wondering about that. I mean, I think you kind of know that that was probably what was going on, but then, you know, and then moving you how harsh and critical she was issues with Brooke, you know, even I still even remember to, for her to have gotten to the point where she wouldn't even let you like go to your grandmother's funeral or at least you know, kind of, so all those things have been so like, you know, front and center, you know, and so now I feel like that she's made this real dramatic shift and, you know, wanting to start being a mom, that sounds like that. You're really working to try to manage that in, you know, in a better way? Yeah. I mean, like we still butt heads a little bit. I'm sure Shane but yeah, yeah, but when you do butt heads, what is it how what happens in terms of your eating when you guys kind of like you feel like that there's a little bit of a friction. I mean, I guess that's like, kind of leaps back to things like things are really good this weekend for the most part and then kind of when I was leaving she just like, either just brought up things about wanting to know more about life and whatnot and what's going on at school and if I'm seeing anyone, yeah, it's just like, we don't have that relationship. Right. So that really, that's a really stressful time?  like when I got back to school like right after that. And like caught me. Well, it makes a lot of sense because again, you know, like, you know, we've really reviewed this quite a bit but You know, historically, that's how it's been, you know that that's really been a real enemy. It really clarifies why we're working on this because it's so clear that when the two of you have like these rough patches, that it really all of a sudden evokes all these like negative feelings. And that's when food like really, you know, you know, all comments, though. Yeah. What I'm wearing. Right. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. So it's really hard to, you know, I can understand it's really hard to let that go. I mean, cuz obviously, there's a lot of lot of feelings that you have about that. Yeah. Yeah. But on the other hand, too, it seems like that, you know, things have been going really well. How have things been going in terms of just in general like school friendships, you know, anything else that's on the horizon?  yeah, kind of scene guy. I won't get too excited about that. But tell me about him telling you about him. Yeah, he felt like my mother. Now what's this? You have to at least give me his name? What's his name? His name's Alan. Alan. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, did you like, I'm not gonna blow this out of proportion. But how? How did that kind of come about? Yeah, cost together and kind of went and studied at a coffee shop. Yeah. And then just kind of asked to, like, do a movie night. And I was like, chill and good. Nice. Ya know, like, Yeah. Nice. Nice. That's great. Oh, I'm really happy. That's great. So, a lot of really nice things that are going on. Yeah, that's terrific. Yeah. So then for you to go like from, you know, because, you know, we kind of got going with this thing. It was kind of like, you were full on binge eating, you know, virtually every day, sometimes twice a day, and now it'd be down to, you know, three, like in the space of like, you know, just like seven eight weeks is pretty remarkable. So no, I'm really pleased with how hard you've been working cuz you've really been pushing yourself. And I really appreciate it. I know this stuff with your mom is particularly hard. It's hard for you is like not being able to, like I don't feel comfortable really telling her yet about. And you may not, you know, I mean it's like, you know, another we talked about there's like maybe there are times when you just don't really want to share some of that stuff. You know, and and I think sometimes my experience has been some parents, like, you know, the goal is not to make her feel bad. If you would want to share it, you'd want to share it knowing that she would hold on to that and keep it and really connect with you around it and want to be helpful rather than like, like, Oh, yeah, you were so mean to me now have an eating disorder, you know, because then that that feels, you know, that doesn't feel quite right. And know that that's, you know, I know that you have a lot of hard feelings, but I don't really feel like that. That's how you'd want that to go, you know? Yeah. And I know we've talked about it a lot, but how are things going with your dad? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he's doing well, hoping that he's coming up here to school to see me once he plays a couple weeks. Great. So nice. They'll be really nice for you to spend time with them. That's great. That's really great. Yeah. So let's talk some more about this thing with your mom, because I feel like that. I mean, I know it's tough, but I guess I've been thinking about this a lot, especially after last session that that given the fact that, you know, you and Brooke are so close, and it does feel like that your mom is, at least she seems like she's making she's trying to make an attempt to connect with you. Whether or not, you know, at what point would you feel like that you? Well, what would you need from her in order to feel like that you could kind of like, maybe not let down the walls, but kind of soften those a little bit. I mean, is there something is there something that like, if you could ask They're like, okay, mom, if you did this, then I would do this. Not that you would do that. But just wondering if like, what would you? ideally what would you like to see in order to feel like that you could connect with her more. I mean, like, I wish she really recognized like, kind of the pressures that she put on me back in the day, huh? Yeah, and just like now to just know just kind of be there in the moment. So like, trying so hard to like, things still come out. Like she still makes her little comments that they. Yeah, I know. We talked about this, but have you gotten to the point yet where you felt like that you could? Like, even let her know that. That that puts a lot of pressure on you or that that comment that she makes kind of hurt your feelings because I know that in the moment you feel it. But what would it be like for you if you were to just like, yeah, say like, you know, I know that you're I know that you mean Well, I mean, maybe she doesn't, but maybe it's sometimes important to approach it that way, but it really hurts my feelings or, you know, I feel like that that really puts a lot of pressure on me to look a particular way. And, you know, so I mean, I am seeing that I like starting to see that she does mean well. right, because I know that you did that. You've done that with your roommate. I know there's been other times when people have done that. So I know that that's been kind of part of the bigger issue is just knowing what it is you're feeling and also being able to kind of give voice to that and you know, thinking about that relationship with your mom because it does seem like that every once in a while she kind of like jabs here, she'll send something out and and, and the way that you take it in is more like harsh, critical. You know her and, and I just don't know like color. It's kinda like with Kathy. When you Talk with her how it's like, it was like, it was like, Oh, of course, like, you know, uh, you know, I'll try to be more sensitive and I'm not really sure. You know whether or not your mom would be. Yeah, I mean, I guess she could do. Yes, I worry that, because we've always been kind of defensive towards each other. I just worry that like, that will happen again. I mean, I don't know, like it might not because of things happen. Right. But yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I think there are times when I wonder if like, maybe if there's a time when you say something, like, I know there have been times when you kind of snap back at her, you know, or you'll kind of like, you know, barber or kind of jabber a little bit. What if, you know, again, you What have you thought about like, because it sounds like that you're really aware when you do that? Because you know that when she says something, you have a tendency to jet back. You could just say, you know, You know, I realized I was I, that was a that was a jab at you. And I'm really sorry, I aware that that sometimes I kind of get really critical with you and I that doesn't I don't feel very good about that. Now I wonder how she would you know if, if that would, what that would do, maybe, maybe it wouldn't do anything or may make you feel a little bit too vulnerable, but you think about it, I mean, and you kind of Mull that over in your mind about what that might be like, because my experience has been that sometimes. You know, I hate the phrase, be a bigger person, because then you know, I didn't want that to come across that way. But sometimes in order to change relationships, somebody has to be willing to kind of like, kind of be willing to do something just a little different. And since it seems like you have a growing awareness of, you know, the interactions that you have with her I wonder if that might be worthwhile. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. mulling over and think about it and, and we'll keep talking about it. But yeah, sounds like it was a really terrific week and been working really hard it really pays off because again, the more you've done that we've seen real positive impact on your eating so nice","The patient advised their roommate about roommate's boyfriend that her studies are really important and to respect each other spaces. Being direct was helpful. The patient got to spend time with Brooke who turned seven recently and with Mom. Mom has been trying to be kind and nice to the patient.

33,"Summarize: Sarah, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. It could be a little better but could always be worse, but I'm going okay, good. Okay. I understand you have some symptoms that have been bothering you. They have been bothering me. Well, I just started back to school last year, I was staying at home while my husband was working with the kids are crawling now out of the house. So I said I was gonna go back to school. I have been in school in 20 years, and I thought I could handle it. But right now, I just find myself so anxious and just so worried all the time. And I just don't know what to do with it.

36,"Summarize: Hi, Alex. My name is Tony. I'll be your nurse for today. How are you doing? I'm okay, I guess just waiting for the stitches to come out and be nice.  Oh, what happened? Oh, God. Can you tell me a little bit more about this firefight? kit storytime you're ready for this. So brown my girls having a fantastic time looking off on fleek and fish. And then this girl, like she has the nerve to stare at me from across the room. It gives me kind of kind of like this. And then she comes up to me, she bumps into me spills my drink. And she comes up and then she's like, a man. So I'm like, excuse me. So obviously I pushed her she pushed me kind of thing. And yeah, one thing led to another I it's a it's a blur from that point on but all I know is cops showed up. I'm here and I have this to deal with. Fantastic right? Well from from what I'm getting here. As you were intoxicated at that point in time, and you had a conversation with this girl, which led to the firefight,  Miss Allison or the toxic get out smashed, should have seen it. But like, this type of thing doesn't happen often. So I don't want you to be sitting here and referring me to some aka because Yo, I'm not an alcoholic. Okay, so it seems like you get offended and feel offended. being referred to it.  Yeah, exactly.  Right. Yeah. All right. Well, we do have some time right now. If it's okay with you. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about your drinking habits.  Yeah, sure.  Sure you what is drinking do for you? Well, you know being 25 that's what we do. Like we get together we hang out we get a couple of drinks. It's me and my girls. We do this all the time and I love this. It breaks the ice when we go socialize. So, meet new people kind of thing. You know, girlfriend circle. It's fantastic. And it definitely relaxes me after a stressful week and my weeks are so stressful as I need this, you know? So, I mean, yeah, but just so you know, I do drink responsibly and I never drink and drive and I don't intend on doing that.  Okay, so to me, it seems that drinking is your way of relaxing with your friends. It's your way to socialize and it breaks that is right, it helps you socialize and, you know, I'm I also wanted to say that it's very responsible of you to be drinking and not driving. Thank you. How has it affected your life? Who hasn't? Well, I mean, none of this happens and you have it because of that firefight. And he's gonna be disappointed. Sorry. I guess you could say that my relationship with Henry, it's been great, fantastic. But he says that when I drink, it's like, I'm not myself. It's like somebody who's never met before. And obviously, you can imagine the arguments, the fights, and oh my god, all that stress. It's just, I love them so much, but you know, but it's a stress and it's like, I don't forget to make it. So for my understanding, drinking, it helps you socialize with friends, it relaxes you. It's, you know, your way of just, you know, it breaks that ice for you. On the other hand, it's causing that a lot of arguments with you and your significant other Henry. Yeah. And it's causing a lot that all those arguments are leading to a lot of stress in your relationship, this kind of stuff. Yeah, I mean, we're engaged in this as well. Like you put it that way, I mean, worried because what's he going to think of you later on in life? What's he going to tell our children? Oh, your mom's an alcoholic. She drank this and they got into fight. I don't want I don't want anyone to ever think of me that way. But at the same time, I mean, I don't want to quit cold turkey. I mean, you must understand how hard this is for me to even be here and talk about it. But I love him so much. I mean, I would do anything for him. And he's going to be so disappointed in me hasn't even seen him like, I don't know, how can I face them? This seems like a very lucky guy to have someone love him that much. Boy, seriously, he's not gonna find anybody that loves him. As much as I do. Trust me on that is not going to happen. So what I'm getting here right now is that if you do want to quit, yeah, yeah. And it's just partly because this alcohol is divided into the arguments with Henry and his positive SSL relationship. Yeah. I know we spoke about earlier and I know you don't really like like the idea of it but what do you know about it? Like what's your one shed some light on that it's a place where alcoholics go to discuss their problems and like I said, I'm not an alcoholic. Well, you're a different multiple philosophy life and this share the drinking stories, and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey of being sober together. Okay? I know you don't want to join a at this point in time 10 times but hypothetically speaking, generally consider joining it maybe later on down the road. If this is what I have to do to get my guy back and I'll do it. Okay, well on a scale of one to 10 being like for sure. And one being not really sure about it at all. What would you say where you are on the scale with God any?  You put it that way? Everything I told you, I would say Six,  six. Yeah. Well, it's all about, it's all about Henry at the end of the day, it's it matters to me if I want to keep this engagement, and I will do anything for that man. So of course, this is what I have to do in this. This is him. Let him tell you, his relationship with me. And I'm with him is so much more important to me than drunken nights at a bar. I love you, man. Like I said. I'll tell him that. Yeah. So right now we're sitting at a six or what needs to happen. Maybe we can jump that money or nine, um, you know, like, flexible hours, maybe that isn't even an option. Um, also, maybe there's maybe there's a place nearby somewhere like nearby My house, I'll be great. So I have to use gas because it's expensive already to go to work and it's far anyway. And I'm like, I guess, I guess it has to do with attitude as well. I don't want to sit there in a circle like this and somebody judging me because the way I look in my drinking habits and all that, so I guess I'm just looking for a good vibe, you know, I don't want to be judged or labeled. Now, all of these are like very understandable. I mean, it's just Of course, you want some in a meeting to be close to us. You don't have to commute so far. And yeah, we all have very busy schedules. Now the fit is very busy schedule. It definitely makes sense. And of course, the environments I mean, if you're not happy, they're just a human a learning environment. If you're not comfortable there, then it's very hard for you to you know, to be in that environment. Yeah. blotchy today, I was wondering if it's okay with you, I can give you this for sure. It's just for a median. You're really close to your location where you live, okay, and my number is also on there. Give me a call if you have any concerns. And also, I just want to thank you today for sharing me your stage of drinking. And I know it's not, you know, easy to just notice. No, it's a very sensitive subject. Yeah. So I want to thank you . Thank you for listening to me. No one's has actually sat down and talked to me about anything. I feel like you shed some light on an issue. So thank you. You're very welcome really means a lot. You're very welcome. And if it's okay with you, perhaps we can schedule another follow up meeting. I'd say about two weeks or so. Yeah, that sounds fine. Yeah, that's okay. Two weeks work. Two weeks. Yeah.","The patient got some stitches and has been in a firefight. The patient was out with their girls, where a girl bumps and pushed the patient's drink. One thing led to another, it was blur and the cops showed up. The patient was intoxicated during the firefight and is offended be called an alcoholic.

Henry feels that the patient is altogether a different person when drunk and it is a lot of stress for the patient. The patient loves Henry so much. The patient is asked about community where different people share the drinking stories, and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey of being sober together. The patient says a six on ten for joining that community. The patient finds hassles in joining community in terms of flexible hours, reaching the place if it is far away, and also people judging the patient looking at their drinking habits. The therapist offers a place which is close to the patient's house and asks to call them if needed. The patient is glad to have talked about this. The therapist schedules another meeting in two weeks. "
37,"Summarize: Okay,  you're doing okay? Yeah I understand your father budget today is a little worried about I might be feeling. yeah. I mean, he's worried that I'm depressed, but I am not. Yeah, he had mentioned that you had some concerns about some things going on in a neighborhood and you call the police a few times.  He told you that? They told me about that. Well, yeah, I mean, I had called I have called the police a few times because there's something going on in my neighborhood. And it's, yeah, makes me seem like I'm depressed but I'm not I just I'm concerned. about what's going on. sure you're not depressed, you're more concerned. So what's going on? We live it's misleading to these feelings. Um, well, it's actually very scary, huh. There I know about. The government has been kidnapping girls in this area and taking them away for sex trafficking and prostitution. to boot the government is apprehending people in the area relive I know they are, you know they are  Yes. And did you see things that's specifically led you to believe this? Yeah, yes. So, there specifically were two girls that lived down the street. And I saw a man Come come down the street and The girls were taken. And that's when I initially called the police. But I found that they're in on it to the police are in on it too. Yes. They tried to tell me that the girls were they're safe and where they're at, but I know they're not. So then they investigated what you saw. And they came back and told you that they pretended to,  they pretended to investigate. Yeah. And they came back and told you everything was okay. But you're not. I know. I mean, I know it's a lie. Because, you know, I saw that I haven't seen a girl since like, I saw the girls on the street. The man came, the girls went out there. And they told me everything's fine. But I know there's a lie and I won't go back to the police again, because I know that they're now on it. They're in on the, what the government's been doing. So what do you think of your father's concerns with, he's concerned that you're, that you're down there depressed, and that your thinking hasn't been been clear? When you think about his concerns?  I mean I know he's, he's worried about me. But, you know, it's interesting to understand the severity of the situation. And, you know, it's hard. It's hard to sleep. I'm thinking about these poor girls. And, you know, it's the government, like, the government has cameras everywhere, and they can watch what I'm doing it all times. And it's, you know, it's exhausting. So I can see how he would think I'm depressed. Because, you know, I'm bored. I, you know, I'm not sleeping well, and I'm not eating because what if they poisoned my food? You know, they're poisoning water all the time. So, you know, it is scary and it is affecting anybody. It's not depression. You're not you're not depressed. No I'm sad for those girls. And I'm scared for, for me and like what's going on? But, you know, I want to make sure that this doesn't happen again because you know, I can't let it happen. We can't let this continue. So that's, that's what's taking up my time right now. And how long has this been going on? For a few months, a few months is that when you first saw what You what you believe to be in kidnapping when I saw the kidnapping? Yes those few months ago? Were there any beliefs like this before? Two months? I mean, yes. I've always been aware that the government you know, is probably up just to things that they probably shouldn't be and that they have access and abilities beyond, you know, the normal person. But after I saw the kidnapping, I had proof and so it's it's gotten worse because I feel like they know that I know. So you felt this way for a while, but seeing what you saw two months ago that made you more short? Yes. Because now I have proof because I have proof Have you ever been treated for depression in the past? Yes. My dad has taken me before when he was worried about me. But I, you know, it's never really been depression. It's always been something else. Like, I'm fine. I just, I'm aware of what's going on around me. And I don't think my dad understands that I don't think the places he takes me understands that. So what have the people at the places where he has taken, you know, what have they said about your condition? Um, you know, they, they try to say the same thing that you know, I'm depressed or whatever, but, you know, I know I know the truth and sometimes I just have to play along. Just play along with it. Yeah, because, you know, this is what the government wants, they want me to look crazy. So there's nothing I can do about it. You think they want to discredit you? Because if I if, you know, it's kind of like smearing my good name. They see me in and out of different agencies and appearing crazy. You know, obviously a lot of people don't believe the story they choose not to believe where they get paid off. And they write what they write on my file but it's not true. I'm just know what's going on. Because you know what's going on. That's what's led to all these occurrences. This is This has led to the symptoms. Yeah, like lately Yeah. Like, you know, I haven't been asleep, you know, and, you know, I feel guilty about what's going on. Right. mean that I know and that, you know, I feel it's hard for me to help them, like with, you know, cameras everywhere and I came to the grocery store without being watched. And I know they're watching me so you know, I I do everything else was too, you know like I go to work I do the chores, because I have to make sure they see me going to work chores. So you see you kind of play along. Yeah. All right. So do you ever have any thoughts related to death or dying or anything like that? No. No, like I'm worried. No. You worried about what? I mean. I'm worried about the government, you know, destroying My life, you know, but I don't want to die and I don't think they're going to kill me. I think that'd be too easy. And it would just be more proof. So there'll be more proof that the way you've seen this real correct, because obviously I'm trying to tell people about it. And if I suddenly show up missing, like there, people are going to know. So I know that they're not going to hurt me, but they could make me look crazy and I'm worried about my life. Like them worried in my life. About that way. Hmm. How about any drug or alcohol? abuse? Right? No, nothing. I dont like to use those things. All right. Any medical conditions? No Has there ever been a time when you felt like really very happy, like how lotta energy it was very happy for several days. Not really. That's never happened? No. Okay. Have you ever heard or seen things other people can't hear or see. I think that I'm aware of things that people but no like who'd been hospitalized before? Yes. But again, it was I tried to initially tell my my dad about some things that I never knew about and he had taken me to the hospital but that was before. So, I would like to get him to talk to a counselor today. How do you feel about that? So really necessary today like, Can I come back another day? I think it would be helpful for you. We had a counselor talk to you today. Well, I understand that's what you need to do. So I guess that's what the you know, that's what we need to do to get this over with. That's fine.

I know this is a tough experience for you have a tough time with everything that's going on that you've described. So it's, it's been helpful for you to answer these questions for me. And I just need a couple minutes and I'll get you over to see a counselor and we'll kind of go from there.  Okay, thanks, Sherry.","The patient says that their dad is worried because they are depressed. The patient has called police at times because they believe government kidnaps girls in their area for sex trafficking and prostitution. The patient once complained about a girl gone missing for which the police assured everything is okay. The patient believes police lied and they are in on it. The patient is paranoid about government monitoring everything with cameras. The patient claims that they are just scared and not depressed. The patient has been feeling this for a few months but after they saw the kidnapping, the patient feels they have proof. The patient is also scared that the government knows they know. The patient has been treated before for depression but the patient didn't believe it was depression even before. The patient is worried about government's constant surveillance on them. They do not have thougts related to death. They are not afraid that government might kill them but scared that they might be made to look crazy. The patient has not used drug or alcohol, no medical conditions, not been very happy for several days. The patient has been hospitalized before for saying things to dad that they don't know. The therapist requested to set up with a counselor to talk with the patient and their dad. "
38,"Summarize: Yes, you really get where they're coming from you really understand the suffering bowl. Yeah, I guess maybe that's part of where it's so hard for me is like, I know that I'm causing a lot of suffering for people. Well, let's, let's talk about that. So you're in, you're in a position where you have to make some decisions about people's lives. And sometimes those decisions result in people being separated from the family. Sometimes they don't. Are you really the cause? In the larger picture? Are you really the cause of these families being broken up? I guess not like it's their actions, if they were doing the right things, even if I did come in their kids wouldn't be removed. But it is still hard to be the one that pulls that trigger, you know. Well, you're the immediate cause kind of at the end of the whole process, but the true cause happened years or months before you got there as people made decisions that maybe weren't the best for their children for themselves. So you're really coming in, to some extent the tail end of a long series of behavioral choices Yeah. That's true. Ultimately, for this family that's causing you the cycle that you're worried about. In kind of the looking at the long term lengths, do you think the children are better off? Because they're not with a family right now? I mean, if they get with a good family, which, you know, usually they do. It's, it's good for them, you know, maybe it could be a wake up call for the parents, or if not, at least the kids are getting their needs met and stuff like that. It's probably really hard for the kids and they probably want to go back to their parents. But I think overall, we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think that it would be best for the kids to go to a place where they're going to be taken care of. So immediately, there's some pain because you have to pick up the family but the long run. Maybe there's a better result. Even with that, though, let's talk about the concern you have about making a poor decision. So this based on what you're describing, do you believe this was actually a poor decision? I guess not. It just feels like it is. Yeah, it feels like it is. And it was a tough decision. But looking at it in the weight of the evidence. Maybe you can appreciate that you might have had to the same thing you if you go back in time. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. And I'm not sure anybody else would have made a different decision either. So you really did what you had to do. Because there's still a pain component there for them. You're feeling torn. And you don't want to go through this again? No, I mean, not this feeling. But I do want to keep doing my job. But doing your job in a world where you could make a mistake, that's not as appealing. Yeah, I mean, I guess I always knew I could make mistakes, but it just feels really real now, I guess that is the difference. So in this particular instance, this what you're saying doesn't seem like a mistake. Let's consider a situation where you did make a mistake. That would be the worst case, right? We're just taking things to the worst case scenario. Okay. Your fear here is that in a sense, regardless of what already happened, going forward, you'd be mortified to make an error. Because this pain you're feeling right now. There's just a variable that's thrown everything into chaos for you. So looking around like where you work and and the history of your profession, what's the mistake you see people make from time to time and you'll be frightened of. I guess the biggest mistake you can really make is to miss some form of abuse or something like that. And then someone's hurt. Okay.","The patient feels they are causing suffering for a lot of people. The patient acknowledges that it is best for the kids to be removed but hard to be the one to pull the trigger. The patient feels that initially it is a hard decision for the family and kids to be separated but in the long run, it is a better result. The patient feels torn, a pain component and does not want to go through this feeling. The patient wants to keep doing the job and acknowledges they may make mistake in their job. In worst case, the biggest mistake the patient feels they can make is miss some form of abuse and someone's hurt. "
39,"Summarize: Should I do it today? Okay. You did okay. I understand you haven't been feeling too great lately. I mean, yeah. I i've never like feeling awesome. Really. But lately I've come to my awareness. But you know, I might be wrong. something might be wrong in what way maybe? Well you know it's nothing new but I have a lot of trouble sleeping Yeah, I usually go to bed early, you know, I might go a little bit late. But then I wake up always really early, like, I'll set my alarm for like eight but I always wake up at like, five or something and then I can't get back to sleep. You're waking up earlier than you want to. Yes, I can't get back to sleep, no matter how hard I try. And I'm tired still during the day. I don't have a lot of energy, but it doesn't matter. It just it's hard for me to go to sleep. And it's it's been like that for a really long time. Probably since high school. But, you know, lately I'm just I realized, you know, some days are better than others, but so having a couple weeks here that really like made me feel like shouldn't talk to someone Well, my brother got married and I'm very close to him. And I was really looking forward to the wedding. And then when I when I just I mean, I didn't not enjoy it, but I just didn't have as much fun as I thought I would. And I know it's just because of my mood like that I'm always a little gloomy. You know, my sister, my brother says, I'm like, you're so like, but I was really looking like I, you know, I step out of my comfort zone. I like to try new things. And I was really looking forward to this when I used to love I love weddings, you know, and it's not that I don't love them now, but I thought I would enjoy it more than I did. And that kind of like, freaked me out. So so your mood, your mood, didn't elevate Like, maybe you hoped it would. Yeah, I mean, I would have thought that I mean, I've been looking forward to this reading for a year and a half I, you know, I helped, you know, my now sister planet, and it just wasn't as fun as I wanted it to be. Or as I thought it would be, you know, and realizing, this is what brought in today. Yeah, and like right afterwards, like last week. You know, it was I've more worst days than better days like I woke up early the next morning even though I had been up late at the wedding. And just sat there and thought about it and was really just upset by the whole thing upset that I couldn't be more happy. Or, you know, my brother and for me really not even for my brother just because I was happy for him. just didn't feel excited like everyone else. Everyone else around me was having such a good time and I was just more down. Yeah, like I was happier than I would be if I was sitting at home by myself, but I wasn't. I wasn't like everyone else. All right, so you you mentioned that this is a go to one from high school. Yeah, sure. How long would that be? Oh, I mean, I graduated in 2010. So eight years. So about eight years and even even feeling down has the sleeping problem for that one. Yeah, I mean, I a little bit when I was in high school, I thought it was, you know, I was just a quirk or something about staying up late and like ours in high school, but it never Like I got better even when I you know started working out of school and stuff I mice sleep schedule never came to that normal eight hours a night like you're supposed to I don't know whatever it is, but it just never. Yeah. So sleeps always been an issue and I just like I said my brothers called me or for years just because you mentioned the word gloomy. Yeah. And the low energies been a problem for that long as well. Yeah. And you've been waking up earlier than you want. Yeah. How about you? Do you mentioned the depressed mood? You feel down? Is that worse than a particular time of the day? Yeah, I mean, it's worse than that in the morning. Especially when I'm just like sitting there with my thoughts. When I can't get back to sleep. It will be That and then you know we time to get ready for the day and I'll be angry and mad that it's, you know the I can't sleep and then depressed about you know that I'm like this and I'm weird and then I mean as the day goes on I forget about it a little bit and it gets a little bit better in the afternoons and nighttime I really like you know, I enjoy spending time with my family for dinner and stuff like that. So it gets better as the day goes on. But, you know, in the morning it's it's bad because I just spent hours lying there thinking about it. It was the morning mornings the worst. Yeah. So I'm gonna ask you some other questions related to this. You mentioned depressed mood. And you mentioned how you reacted to the wedding. How it wasn't what you hoped. Have you lost in In other things that might be fun or pleasurable. I haven't really lost an interest in anything like I still, you know, I still seek out fun activities, and I still participate in them. And I mean, they'll make me feel better than not doing them. But it's just, I don't know, it's just I don't. I guess my response to them isn't as high as I see other people enjoying activities, and I don't, but I do enjoy them as much Okay. Any changes to your appetite or weight? No one stays the same. How about feelings of restlessness or the opposite kind of being slowed down? I know that. No. Ever feel a sense of worthlessness? No,  like that. How about concentration? How's that been? Let's focus on what I need to focus on. You do okay with that? Yeah. Do you ever have thoughts of death or dying? No. Any drug or alcohol use or medical conditions. No Have you ever seen or heard things other people cannot see or hear? No Have you ever had a time? You mentioned your mood is gloomy. Have you ever had a time when your mood was too happy? Like when you're excessively happy? A lot of energy? Not really. I mean. Yeah, like there's been times where I've like gone on vacation for like a week and I've noticed that I was happier than I had been, but nothing ever more than a couple of days or a week or so, here been hospitalized before. No Do you have feelings of hopelessness? No. And how's your self esteem? Okay. Okay. Yeah,  pretty good. All right, Sherry. I'd like to get you in to see a counselor here at the agency. If I just take a couple days to to get you in with somebody is that okay? Okay. I appreciate you answering these questions. For me. This has been helpful.","The patient has trouble sleeping.

40,"Summarize: Carl How you doing today? Good,  good how are you? I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. Last week you were talking in therapy? Yeah. I mean, I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week, but but Jill was telling you about Jill, a co worker. And, you know, she was kind of bothered me the past couple weeks, but really, this this past week was like the worst, right? So she's not doing her paperwork. And the thing is, is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports. So if she doesn't have hers, I can't do mine. And then I can't get mine out in time for the next person to do theirs and it's a mess. The whole thing's a mess. And it's just it's annoying. So her work slow down, or not being efficient work is affecting your work productivity. Yeah. Yeah, it definitely is. And it it's one of those things that like, you know, has, it gives me a bad a bad evaluation, you know, like, if I'm not in my stuff in in time, the number reflects negatively on me, you know, and it's it's all kind of she's she's the first level, you know, and then all the other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time. So she doesn't, then I don't then the next person and so forth, and it makes it seem like you're not doing her job, right? Yeah. And my boss doesn't like it. my boss's boss doesn't like and so forth. You know, and I try to explain them. You know, she's the problem, but it doesn't always I don't always have the time to go up and tell them like, here's what's happening or just somehow it doesn't Now, you don't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about the situation. Yeah. And that's pretty annoying too. Because, you know, it's one thing if people get mad at me, but then I'm able to tell them why I'm not doing my job, like I'm supposed to. But it's another thing for them to get mad at me. Not realizing it's not my fault. You know, you have an explanation for why that works. Yeah, I do. I do. That's the thing. But I can't always get it out. You know, I can always tell the person that's has the complaint about and yeah, I mean, I've tried talking to my, my boss. And I've tried talking other people too, you know, but really hasn't gotten anywhere. So you're feeling stuck with this whole thing? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I talked to Joe a little bit about it, too. You know, and I tried to ask, I tried to kind of gently reminding her, you know, like, such and such needs to be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o'clock. I didn't want to be real abrasive, you know, but I, I tried to remind him as a polite approach. Yeah. Yeah. And it didn't didn't really seem to work because it's still happening. You know, your attempt to fix the problem hasn't really worked the way you want. It really hasn't. And, and that's just, I feel like I've tried everything that I could try. You know, and even like, I came home and I was talking to a friend about it, and I was trying to think of other solutions, right. You know, I was trying to think like, what else I could do what else I could say. Who else I could talk to things like that. You know, and my friend, you know, you He was listening and stuff. He had some good suggestions, but he didn't know what to do either like cuz he doesn't know the way the company works. So like, I got nothing. You're not getting the help you need for this. Yeah, not at all feeling pretty lost with it. And I wish there was just like a clear way to do things like this is what you should do now. And I don't see anything some sort of clear plan. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, I don't I don't see a way to go about it. I mean I've so I've Okay, so this is the way I laid out in my mind. I tried talking to the people above me didn't work out the way I thought it would. I tried talking to the people below me so to speak, just lower on the before me in the process. That's what I mean. And that didn't work out which is just Jill and I talked to her and that didn't work. So like, there's nowhere else I could turn. The options are exhausted. Yeah, that's what it seems like to me. And this is frustrating for you. Yeah, it is. And I've been trying to wrack my brain. You know, like, what else could I do? You know, like, maybe if I could maybe if there was like, a committee or something that I could go to, you know, and be like, well, this person's not doing what they're supposed to be doing. But there's not a committee like that. Or even if there was like a person, you know, like, a resolution person or whatever, but there's nobody like that. There's no other avenue.  It sort of seems like to me Yeah. I mean, that's and you know, as I'm even trying to think like, I don't know, should I Write a letter to somebody maybe. But I don't even know who or what you thought about a letter. But who would you send it to? Yeah. Or like just something else that I can I can do instead of going to this person though to that person that didn't work. Can I can I call somebody is there anybody else in the company that you know might handle stuff like that? But I mean, there's there's HR people, but I can't really see where they could come in. I don't know how human resources could deal with something like that. You don't view them as a potential solution. No, I don't. Wondering if there's like a But there's I mean, I'm thinking now that there's gotta be something or somebody, or somewhere that I could put in, like, almost like a complaint or something like, something's out of my hands. And I don't know what to do about it, but there's got to be something. And now that I'm saying this, I'm thinking that there's got to be some other resource you haven't tried yet. Yeah, yeah. I mean, now I'm trying to think back to my training, you know, initially you know, maybe there's, you know what, I think now that I'm, now that I'm thinking a little bit harder about a little bit differently about it. I'm thinking that there's like, man, I forget what they call it now, but maybe like a complaint but It's not the right word, but maybe a complaint box or like suggestions or something. And I think, if I remember correctly, those suggestions and those complaints get brought up at every staff meeting, which we have, like every other week. They're discussed at this regular meeting. Yeah. And I'm thinking now, I mean, nobody really uses it. But I'm thinking like, maybe that's an avenue that I can use, you know, like, maybe that'll get brought up. And maybe that's something that that might actually work.  This could be another option for you. Yeah, it could be. And then if it does work, it'll get brought rather if they do read it, it'll get brought up at the staff meeting. where everybody's at my boss, my boss's boss, Jill, everybody's there. And maybe that's a way for it to come to most attention. That deadlines being missed, affect other people in ways that you don't really know about. So everyone will hear your complaint and maybe react in a way to help you maybe. Yeah, I think that's, I mean, that's gotta be the way to do it. And maybe that's the best way. I really think. Yeah, I mean, after saying all that, and after going through that, I really think that that's probably the best way to do it. And if it doesn't, then I guess I can find another way. But I really think that's the best way to do it. You feel as though you found an option here? Yeah. Yeah. And even if that doesn't work, then it'll be brought up. And maybe it'll allow me to talk to my boss further about it. And maybe I'll understand really where I'm coming from. But this will at least be a start to something you know, to make me a lot less stressed with deadlines and stuff in your first Started with all this. Yeah. But maybe, maybe after I do that, you know, put in the complaint or suggestion. Maybe I won't be as frustrated. I mean, I'm feeling a little less frustrated now. Even thinking if there is another option. It feels better now as you're contemplating and another potential Avenue here. Yeah. Yeah, that's, well, this might be a good place to wrap this session up. That feels like the right. Move for you. Yeah. And we'll schedule See you next week. And we can pick up from there. Sounds good. All right. Cool. Next car. Thank you.","The patient has an issue with their co worker who has not been doing their paperwork for the past couple of weeks. This annoys the patient and affects their efficiency in work productivity. The co worker is first in line and it affects everyone's work which their boss doesn't like.

41,"Summarize: Jasmine how you doing today? Okay, okay. What's been going on? I just been dealing with so much anger that I'm having difficulty controlling in my everyday life a lot of anger. Yeah. Can you give me some examples? Like for instance, I go to the dry cleaner, the pickup my fiance's uniforms, and the lady had them like ball bag together and I mean, I could have easily just asked her because she separate them. But I begin to yell caused a big commotion because I was so frustrated and angry. She actually was about to call the police escort me out. And I don't think I'm even allowed to go back to the driveway anymore. So quite a bit of anger.  Yeah. My neighbor's dog was barking late at night. I know my neighbors when they can't control that. But I get into a huge fight with my neighbors argument. We're not speaking at the moment and it's just raw uncomfortable. But, I mean, I feel bad now that it's over with none. I thought about it. And I just don't know why I was so upset that the dog was work. Right. So from your perspective, it doesn't seem to make sense why he got so angry.  No, I just it's been going on for some time. Now. I just get little things just I just explode. So i don't know why did anything change around the time that I started? Nothing that I can really think of just when I'm overwhelmed. I have so much to do. I kind of just break down and just become extremely upset with everything around me. Alright, so you're getting upset you have some anger any other time that you're feeling angry when I go to the go workout at the kickboxing class I'm like the go all out like I use that as like a release. I'm punching the bags of shame before I actually had hurt my wrist last week. I just go all out in there and my trainer kind of notices like are you okay? And I'm like it's just relief kind of gained all the anger I had been out so. Alright, so that experience for you. You feel like you're releasing more energy than maybe the other people in the game can wait You are way more I'm like loud, I'm sweating bullets. I'm just going all out like extremely angry. Alright, so the in recent memory, your anger has increased, but it's still not really clear what's going on. that's causing the anger. Not really I just feel like frustrated does have so much going on at the moment. So it's kind of like just feel overwhelmed, I guess not take it out. You feel busy, like in your daily life, like a lot of responsibilities? Yes, a whole lot and what kind of things you're doing. Mainly, mainly take care of home does not mean I don't I don't work or anything. So I kind of just take care of home and, you know, with the kids and everything, it's just a lot. So see a lot of responsibilities in the home. Guess all of the responsibilities all It feels like all of them? Yeah. What type things are you doing? I'm cooking, I'm cleaning. Now I have to earn all of my husband's uniforms and get everything ready for him. I had to make sure I cook breakfast I had to make sure I pick lunch. I had to make sure I have dinner ready income I had to help the kids with their homework. I just have so much going on like it's constant, catering, catering, catering, cater and it feels like I just really don't get a break or any other help is just made every day. You're doing everything and has always been this way. Not always but it seems it's been like this for some time. Okay. Where you're really just doing everything in the home. Everything. I want to ask you Can I ask you or mention a few words? Right? I would like you to, if you're okay with this exercise, tell me the first thing that comes to mind like and you can buy say a word, you can offer several responses. But try not to invest a lot of thought into the response more just what occurs to you. Oh, but does that make sense?  Yeah. All right. So the first word is structure, responsibility. repetition, repetition. All right. Let me give you another word, relationship. conflict, power struggle. disagreements. Let me offer you another word work. Independence, freedom able to express creativity. Good, alright. How about another word here? Power of constant struggle extremely controlling. So do you see any themes and in the words that you provided back Seems like everything is like really controlled and structured,  controlled and structured? What's the source of that controlling structure? Is there a source of it? A lot of it may come from my fiance. Now that I'm thinking about it. Somebody told me you're thinking, because I feel that he doesn't give me the freedom or the ability to do a lot of the things that I would like to do like work, and I think he should help more with the kids around the house and do things and I shouldn't have to do everything. And I feel like that's probably why I'm so frustrated because I felt that I don't have any help. It's like I'm single, and I'm doing everything on my own. So this project where the bulk of my frustration is coming from So as you're telling me this and you're explaining kind of that relationship with your fiance What are you feeling? I'm feeling angry and disappointed. Like I don't really know if I want to further anything because well it'd be like this forever just like angry, frustrated is a similar to the anger that you've been experiencing recently. Like at the dry cleaner places. It's far worse than it but it's like I think that's where why I'm always so upset and angry. Serious thinking that maybe that relationship or something part of that relationship is what's really causing the anger. Yeah, cuz I feel alone at the same time completely. Like I'm not in a fair relationship is like I'm in control and I don't have freedom to do anything. I don't have help and it's just it's laying a lot of stress on me. So is this is your talk about this do you feel like this is new information you're kind of realizing something that you didn't realize before it because honestly, I kind of I never really focused on that aspect of it. I kind of just thought that's the way it should go. And I just thought I was angry because I just hate bad deeds. I've never really looked deep into it because I try so hard to make everything in my family, right. So I kind of really don't pay attention, I kind of ignore it. But now that I'm thinking and pointing out different things, than into how I really feel. So you feel this, this kind of big moment in terms of awareness. Definitely because I don't think I would have like I said, I think I'm kind of try to hide it and really don't focus much on it because I want things to be perfect. So they got a kind of ignore it. Okay, so maybe through this session, you develop more insight about what's contributing to the anger. Yeah, definitely. Cuz I would just go off for no reason at all and just later to think about like, why did I even do it? But But this source of anchor, this relationship, you recognize this is maybe more causal or more contributing? Yeah. Where's the other objects of your ad? If you weren't really sure, I wasn't sure at all. Why. But with that, I definitely could see the reasons why. All right, chess move. I feel like we've made some progress here. And I'd like you to between now and next session, if you're comfortable with it, kind of reflect on what themes have maybe come to the surface, what informations may have been revealed to you a little bit. And we can pick up there and explore this further with the anger issue. So that's like a good plan. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. It's good. Well, I appreciate you coming in today, and I'll see you in week. Okay. Thank you.","The patient has difficulty controlling anger in everyday life. The patient feel they explode for little things.

42,"Summarize: hi you how to do it today. Great. How are you? I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. So doing great. I noticed today your brother rush in. And he has some concerns about how you remove a spin. I mean, I don't know why because I mean it's been awesome for like a week I've been getting so much done. You know at work, I finished both reports that I've been working on.

I haven't been, you know, irritable or anything during the day and at night, I get a few artists late, but the rest of the time I'm like, you know, either working on work or my house or whatever. So I mean, I've slept like in less but it's not an issue. No, it's you're sleeping less but you don't feel tired at all. Okay, yeah. Do you Find yourself more easily distracted by anything. things around you. No Not really like that. You mentioned you get a lot of things done at work. How about at home? Yeah, I mean, so my daddy room, I feel like more in new China and stuff like that. So I've gotten everything set up. You know, I hadn't finished unpacking all my boxes from when I moved in. So I've gotten all the boxes on packed. You know, even like things like placemats and whatever, like, it looks like a home now and I'm really liking what I'm doing if you're accomplishing you're accomplishing a lot. Know, when your brother can brush in, he'd mentioned some shopping and that's one of the things he was certain about. Yeah, well, so I on the weekend, I had gone ahead and when shopping and I kind of went on a shopping spree. And I had bought, like I said, my new China and I got some kitchen utensils too and a couple things for around the house like home decor. And I called him because I had ran out of space to take everything I was at the mall. So I was hitting a lot of different stores. And I've run out of space to put everything in because I really wanted to actually get a new dining room set like tables and chairs and maybe a cabinet and he has an SUV. So I called him to see if he could come in so I could purchase the items but he said he wasn't he couldn't come out and I guess he kind of said he was worried about you spending that much money. Which I don't know. I don't know why he would be just from me calling him but I think that's why he was concerned it but he didn't come I didn't get the dining room set or anything. You remember how much you spent I don't know exactly, because there's lots of different stores. But, you know, I have a couple different credit cards. So one credit card I used was declined by the end. So it was probably, you know, I didn't need to get the dining room set. I could have used a different credit card, but obviously it's been enough. Dude, I feel like you spent more than you usually would spend a trip to the mall. I never really go on shopping sprees. And I really treat myself like that. So I mean, yes. But I again like I haven't, you know, I needed all those things that I got from my apartment. So have you ever had a time in the past when you felt this way where you felt really good? Not like this. Now is the first time I've just feel like, you know, life's falling into place right now. Life's fall into place. So you're feeling pretty good. You feel like things are On your way I do you get a lot accomplished. Any sadness or anything like that? No, no. A change in appetite. You seem to have a good amount of energy. Any feelings of worthlessness? No Any thoughts of death or dying? NO drug and alcohol use? No no medical conditions. No. Have you ever had time in the past when you felt depressed? I mean, I have been depressed in the past. Yes. Yeah. But I mean, I feel like that's, I feel like it was it was a different person. And I feel like, you know, I haven't had any of those symptoms. You know, and I feel like it's a new me to new you. Yep. So do you know what happened? With the depression the past? Like, did you end up hospital or being treated some other way?  No, no. Just no treatment? No. I mean, I've talked to people before about being depressed. But I was never hospitalized for it. But you believe you were depressed? Yes. Now we're back then. Did you see or hear things that other people couldn't see or hear? No, not now. We're back then. NO Okay. All right, Sherry. answering these questions has been helpful to me. I appreciate it. I'm going to get you over to see a counselor. Just a few moments.  Okay. All right. I know that you're feeling pretty good, but I'd like them to talk to you for just a bit.  Okay. Okay, thanks for","The patient was brought in by their brother with concerns of how they remove a spin. The patient feel they are normal, getting things accomplished, keeping house clean.

43,"Summarize: corleto how you doing today? good. I do well, thanks for asking. How'd you do this week? Better? Well, last time we talked about that postponed gratification. Yeah, that um, and I think you wanted 10 minutes for me to put it off 10 minutes. Yeah. So I did better. I think I ended up only doing like join a half instead of two I was able to put offered, I think, the 10 minutes a couple times. And then there were there was, I think one or two days where I went out for a walk because I was Tired of staring at the clock waiting for the 10 minutes to pass. So I got up, went for a walk. And then I passed one of my friends. So I ended up walking with her. And I actually didn't get back to my house for like an hour. So I kind of put it off for like an hour because then I came home and took a couple hits on so it sounds like you were able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana. At least in most cases. It was rough. It was rough. Yeah. So it was it was difficult for you, but most cases, you're able to pull off the 10 minutes. Mm hmm. That sounds like there's a few instances where you're able to hold it off longer because something else kind of Yeah, came up. Yeah, I found I actually talked to a couple people on the phone before I knew it like half hour to come by. so another activity presented itself and You've forgotten with marijuana. Kind of Yeah. Yeah. I guess I just wasn't thinking about it. So have your feelings about marijuana change since we last talked? No, not really.  Tell me about that. I mean, it's I don't see it as a problem. It's it's legal in a lot of states now. And I mean, it's not that bad for you. It doesn't really endanger me much. So you still you still believe you should have the right to smoke marijuana? Yeah, I mean, I'm not hurting anybody else.  But at the same time, you want to go back to work. And if I remember, right, you're the person that you could go work for. I guess you know them right. Yeah, it's my uncle, your uncle, and you need to be cleaned for was about two months. Yeah, two to three months. So you have kind of opposing forces here, right? You have your enjoyment of marijuana. And then you, you know, that's something you like you don't wanna give up. And you believe you have a right to do that. But then there's that job. Yeah, I mean, my parents are pretty cool with it, like they know. But I mean, I'm at the point now where they kind of want me to move on and move out. But I don't know. I mean, I just, it'd be nice to have that job. Like, it's a really good job, but at the same time, like, I don't see why I have to sacrifice something that I like.  So it doesn't seem fair to you. But she recognizes the reality of your situation. Yeah. So it really does come down in your instance to marijuana use or appointment. Yeah, it's pretty accurate. So you're not happy about that choice. And kind of what we did with the postpone gratification was just really just ask you to wait 10 minutes and you were able to do that. And more, although it's difficult,  it's difficult. It's difficult for you. So I asked you to track the number of times you smoke marijuana. Did you really track that over the last week? Yeah, you remember how many times that was?  I think think I think it like 15. Okay, between 15 and 20, between 15 and 20. And how many times did something kind of get in the way that's something else come up in that 10 minutes span that distracted you or that you enjoyed I'm like, almost closer to 20 times I guess, otherwise, I probably would have kept going smoke more. I mean, there were a couple times where like somebody would call me or somebody would text me and that kind of distracted me and so I was able to put it off for a little bit. So you can see in that 10 minutes, things can happen. Right things can happen that can help you to avoid the marijuana. Sometimes nothing does and after 10 minutes, use it. And sometimes something does kind of get in the way with a marijuana like distract you or you have another activity that you enjoy and then you didn't use. So with that in mind you found the experience rough, but was it tolerable?  Yeah, Was it bad  was a bit Do you think for this next week? We could try postpone gratification from 10 minutes to 20 minutes? I don't know. That seems kinda. Yeah, that seems like a longer time that that is definitely. That is a longer time.  I don't know about that. Yeah. Maybe like 15 minutes, no compromises. 15 Okay, do you think you could maintain 15 minutes weighing 15?  I think I could try a little bit more than 20. All right, so let's go with 15 minutes, right. So 15 minutes, you know, as compared to 10. I'll give you five extra minutes that something could happen that could distract you. And you wouldn't use that instance, right. There's also, you know, to constructively use that time, you could consider alternatives like like you mentioned walking right. You could use that time and start walking. Yeah. Anything else that that you like, maybe in the past on occasion when you want to use marijuana, but she didn't have anything available? What would you do instead? binge watch TV, or should it be okay, well, so perhaps in that 15 minute time period that that timer you're delaying using marijuana, you could start watching the show. Yeah, I can do that. At the under 15 minutes, you might end up using marijuana or you might want to continue watching the show. So do you see kind of how it works? Like is it making sense to you the postponing? Yeah, it doesn't make it any easier, but it's tough for you. Yeah. Yeah. No, I definitely see how helps And maybe if we're successful to 15? Who knows? We'll move it up from there. Maybe we'll see how the 15 goes, see how it goes the 15? Yeah, I'll see how that goes. You know, I'm hoping. And I hope this kind of makes sense that there'll be a point where you will be really interfering with the vast majority of the times that use marijuana. Like because you're giving yourself that many more opportunities, the longer you wait. Right. The more minutes you wait, the more opportunities for something else to get in the way so to speak. And probably what you'll see, just like you saw this last because you're, you know, you used marijuana less frequently, just by waiting the 10 minutes. Even though you described as difficult I'm sure it was, but there were a few times where it kind of worked out Yeah. So, I think that planning something for that time would be helpful. And try to plan something 15 minutes, even if you fully intend to beyond the 15 to go right and use, I think it's still useful plan something in there. You never know that might take you. Or you might end up walking or watching TV or doing something else that would distract you or pull you away from the marijuana use. Okay. So that's like a plan. Yeah, I think I can give that a try. Okay Sounds like a plan? Yeah, I think we can manage that. All right. We'll go with that. And I'll see you next week. Okay, thank you.","Last week, postponed gratification was discussed with the patient. The patient has successfully been able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana at least in most cases roughly. There has been instances where patient even forgot marijuana. The patient feels the same towards marijuana since last session since it is legal in many states and does not hurt anybody else. However, the patient has a nice job at uncle's for which they need to be clean for two to three months.  The patient does not see why to sacrifice this for a job. The patient is requested if they can postpone gratification from 10 to 15 minutes. The patient is suggested if they can watch a show to use up time. The therapist clarifies that the patient is giving many more opportunities to interfere by longer they wait. The therapist will see the patient next week. "
44,"Summarize: Hey carla. How are you? it is good, how are you? I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. What's been going on this last week? Um, I've just been feeling like kind of in a rut. I mean, I've been looking for a job and hadn't really gotten anywhere and then the I had a drink the other night. And I just felt like that like me not having a job and going out and having that drink. Like I just, it wasn't deserved, and I just felt like such a loser because I should have that was the time that I should have been at work. If I had a job and instead I was at the bar drinking. So I had one drink, and then Ellen two Do another because then I just felt worse. And I figured I had one. So come on. So how much should you drink in total? I think I lost track after four or five. But How long had it been since you had a drink? before that? I did really well. I it was, I think like three weeks, three weeks or so. She did really well. And then you had you had one drink. And that just made you feel like you weren't successful. I felt like a loser felt like a loser. And you feel that kind of led to drinking some more. So you had a rough time with things? Yeah, yeah. what now I mean, now I just kind of I don't I'm afraid to go back like I'm afraid to go out with, like some friends. They invite me out to dinner. But I know there's alcohol. And is that where you were when that first strike? was out with friends? Yeah. So there's a few things going on. We've talked in the past, right about separating the behavior from the person. Right? So, behavior is what we do, not who we are. You remember those discussions? And correct me if I'm wrong with sounds like I'm using different words than you use. But it sounds like when you had that first drink, you're kind of ashamed that you had a drink and you had it during the time when you would have been working. Yeah, that's pretty accurate. That's pretty accurate. All right. So taking yourself kind of back to that moment. All right, we we had that first. That first drink like you finished that first drank What was your What was your thought at that at that moment? Just like shameful. Like I did really, really well. And then here I was. I just finished a drink and I knew I wanted another one.  Okay, so shameful is kind of like the feeling. But the thought is I did really, really well. Right?  So that's what your thinking was. I did really, really well. And what? was that the end of the thought, or was that was there more before you had that next trick? I guess just I was doing well. And then I had a drink and I just felt like an awful person. So I figured what was the hurt Having more sort of sequence would have been you had to drink. You felt shameful. At the same time you're thinking that you were doing really well. And then just really, as you said before, you just felt like a loser. And then you decided, might as well just have the second drink. So another thought might be that, like, I might just have a second drink. Yeah,  yeah. So you can see others some thoughts and some feelings at work. right as you finish that first drink was a fairly quick, but those thoughts feelings fairly. occur fairly quickly after the drink. Yeah, absolutely. As I was finishing and then finished, so right away, you regret it and that regret As you thought about it, don't might as well just just continue drinking now, because you kind of blew it. I already messed up, I might as well keep going.  Okay. And that's a common cycle to fall into. And you had three weeks, we hadn't had a drink prior to that. So let's, let's look at this. Let's try to separate the behavior from the self a little bit. If you had if you had a friend who was in the same predicament, right, you had a history of using alcohol and then at three weeks, without any alcohol use, and then their behavior was to have a drink. What would you think of them? I think that they had a rough day or something was to happen where I mean, it's just wondering, I had a rough day one drink, and what would you think of their behavior? How would you categorize that behavior? That's just they made a mistake. So not ideal, depending on their point of view, maybe a little irresponsible. Yeah, I think irresponsible, irresponsible, but you wouldn't necessarily characterize them as a bad person.  No. But their behavior was a bit of responsible. Yeah. You know, in terms of like the recovery plan, which would be to not drink. But when you apply that same example examination to your own situation, how do you characterize yourself after you had that first drink? It was my mistake it was in it. It makes me a worse person for doing it. So you see how you're you're being a little bit quite a bit rougher on yourself. Like your your evaluation of yourself is, is fairly harsh. You mentioned loser earlier and ashamed. Whereas you wouldn't necessarily evaluate someone else that way.  How would you evaluate your behavior? How would you How would you judge your behavior taking that first drink? shameful. I mean, irresponsible, which is bad overall. So, so bad, irresponsible, shameful. Is there a way to separate that behavior in terms of in terms of your thinking, the way you evaluate it from yourself, like are you into behavior? together a meshed or can you be separated? I think we could be separated But it, it feels like we're like I am that behavior in that moment. It's very congruent for you. Yes,  the shame matches the behavior to behavior matches shame. Like it's there one at that moment. Mm hmm. But really, logically, rationally, you're you, Ryan, your identity and values and your behavior, something you do. But in the moment, it's hard for you to see that. Mm hmm. Looking back on it now is are you able to see the distinction between what people do and what they are? Yeah I mean, just because you have one drink doesn't make you a horrible person and no, certainly not. And you were, you were clean for three weeks, and you had one drink. So really, your behavior was a slip. Right It was and irresponsible in relationship to your goals, I suppose. But still a slip. And you could have stopped. But that shame got ahold of you. Right. I thought, well, now I've done it. I blew it. Yeah. So with that mentality, you kind of set yourself up for drinking more. So, I think this is important because we've seen this cycle like where you have weeks of sobriety, and then we'll drink a bit and then have weeks as writing. And I'm wondering if part of the difficulty you're facing is you're not coping with the slips as just slips okay. You're allowing them to be gateways into a lot more drinking than the slip. Does that make sense? That That's pretty accurate. And you see how the shameful feelings kind of just interfere with the behavior that you really want that's really consistent with their goals, which would be to not continue drinking.  Mm hmm. Another piece of this too is the association associating with friends who drink, you're putting yourself in a treacherous situation. Again, that's a behavior. Right? That doesn't make you one way or the other. It's a behavior. How would you judge that behavior going out with friends? I don't know. I mean, difficult because I like being around those people. But I guess it would be it's risky. risky, okay. It's a risky behavior. And what does it make you Who are you? Because you do that behavior. Like how do you feel about yourself? When you take that risky, behavior,  guilty,  okay So you have guilt when you go out with your friends. And then you have shame if you drink. And both, in this case, both emotions that kind of point you in the direction of more drinking. So part of this behavioral strategy here is to avoid the circumstances like to recognize that's a risky behavior, which you have. And the other part would be to deal more effectively if you do slip away, right. Does that does that separation of what we do and who we are? makes sense to rationally? kind of feels a little unnatural, though. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe, as you're confronting similar situations in the course of the next week, You could be aware of behaviors that might put you at risk, and try to try to separate your identity from that behavior. So, so just judge the behavior. Okay. Right. And don't don't pass any judgment on yourself. So that makes sense. Kind of Yeah. It might help you to. Since it's a little tough to because right now, the feeling and the judgment, retro twined. Right. It might help to write down when these things happen, and kind of write down like, like one row for this is how I judge this behavior. But I'm thinking about doing and this is how I judge myself. So if you see a lot of self judgment, that might be a clue that you're falling into a cycle a little bit, Okay where you're making decisions based on that emotion instead of a rational judgment and behavior. Okay,  that helped a little bit. Yeah, I think that would probably be beneficial. So that'll be our plan going forward.  Until next week is note document your judgment about your behavior, any judgment you may have about yourself. Right, and there's some insight that can be gained there. Right. Kind of distinguish the two and making those and try to use that evidence before making a decision to might put you in a risky spot.  Okay. Sound like plan? Yeah, I think I can try that. Okay, good. I'll see you next week. And we'll see how you did with those goals. Okay","The patient feels they have been in a rut last week. They haven't gotten a job and have felt like a loser for drinking once. But the patient seems to drink more once they start since they feel like a loser. The patient is scared to go out with friends since there is alcohol. They recall a discussion with therapist saying they feel ashamed when they have the first drink. The patient feels really well but feels awful instantly after the first drink then they continue drinking as such. The patient identifies if someone else drinks after a rough day, they are a little irresponsible but not a bad person. However the patient call themselves bad, irresponsible and shameful for the same. The therapist clarifies to the patient that linking slips to shame makes the patient drink more. They act as gateways. The patient feels guilt when meeting friends and see it as risky. The therapist clarifies part of behavioral strategy is to avoid the circumstances like to recognize that's a risky behavior. The patient is asked to separate what we do and who we are. The patient is asked to write these things down this week and make decisions based on rational judgement and behavior instead of emotion. The therapist will meet the patient next week. "
45,"Summarize: So let's say you go into a house, you go to the community, okay? You go into a house and have an off day. Maybe worried about making mistakes, maybe stressed about that. Maybe tired. And there's some evidence there that you should be able to pick up but you just you don't write somebody lies to you about what the conditions there are You kind of realize that they might not be telling the truth, but you're you're ready to get home. So you leave and then somebody hurt when you have a worst case. That's the type of mistake you're afraid of making.  What would that feel like to make that mistake? Terrible, it would feel like, you know, I had a role in that kind of thing happening to somebody, like I was partially to blame for somebody being harmed. And that is like the exact opposite of what my job is supposed to be. So that would be a worst case outcome. You would be extremely upset. You're extremely upset now. While you're five out of 10 right now, but you're an eight when you're in bed in the morning. Yeah. Is it reasonable that a professional makes a mistake like that? This is the mistake of kind of missing something that normally would be caught. Is it reasonable? They continue on in the field and try to learn from that. I don't know, I mean, I'd like to think that I guess it's not possible to make that kind of mistake, but I think that that's naive. I think it is possible. And I, I would like to learn from that, but I don't know what other people would do. Like I don't know if I would lose my job or anything. Right, there might be consequences for that type of error. It's not intentional, something that like many mistakes would happen due to conflict confluence of circumstances who being tired of being the end of the day, not being honest. There's mitigation there. But still, I can appreciate you would want to make that mistake either way. What would your after making a mistake like that? What would your thought be? Would you be thinking? I would be thinking, I don't know how this will ever be better. I don't know how I'm ever gonna feel okay about what I did. To my extension, I'll never feel okay about what I did. Yeah. And what do you think you would do then in terms of your reaction to that thought? I don't know. I mean, I guess ideally, I would say to myself, it's going to get better. You know, this will pass and everything but I don't know. It's just hard. What do you think would do to your performance? I think I would probably Take some time off. I mean, it's just like I would be so stressed afterwards. And worried I would make another mistake because I'm so stressed out and having trouble focusing. So in a strange way, the anxiety, the thoughts you're having now that result in anxiety, are leaving you more at risk to make a mistake. Yeah, I mean, I guess I never thought about it like that, although that makes a lot of sense. Like it. If I, if I just calm down and try to let it go, then I'll do my job better and I won't have that risk as much. But if I keep feeling like this, I'm not focusing and then I could make a bigger mistake because of it. Right, so one of the thoughts you're having now is you can't make a mistake because it would be too devastating. And that titles like this. I have a thought you're having. So it's like you can't make a mistake. And this is leaving you emotionally less prepared and probably increased risk of making a mistake.","The patient is afraid that somebody lies of the situation and somebody is hurt in the worst case. The patient feels partially to be blamed and are extremely upset. After making a mistake, the patient doesn't know if they every gonna feel okay of what they did. It's hard. The patient feels stressed afterwards of making a mistake and wishes to take some time off. The therapist asserts the anxiety would leave the patient at more risk to make a mistake. "
46,"Summarize: Hi you how to do it today? Great. How are you? I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. So you're doing great. I'm doing awesome. I know your brother brought you in today and he had expressed some concerns about your mood. Do you know what that's about? I, I think he's worrying for no reason. Because I, you know, I for the last like week and a half, I have been following my passion, which is baking. And I didn't realize this before, because I worked in an office. And I just realized that that's not what I want to do with my life. And I know what I want to do with my life now, and I've never known before. So this is an amazing feeling. And what I want to do is I want to start my own baking business. And so what happened was That a couple. Two weeks ago, my nephew had a bake sale. And I've always I've always been like baking, but I've always been like from the box or like from, you know, whatever. So I tried for the first time making brownies from scratch and they were amazing and everyone loved them at the bake sale and they sold out. And my nephew thought I was a hero, basically, I was and so now it made me realize like I could do this for a living and it would make me feel amazing and make me feel like a hero for all these people. And like my college campus would be kind of cool if I could like put up something about like delivering the bakery like the dorms or like big goods to dorms because you know, college students love that type of thing. But so anyway, so I was thinking about long story short, having this business and I would bake all these cookies and I was gonna put up flyers because I don't I'm not like at the point where I can get like an office space but I don't need an office space because I have my apartment and I have everything I need in my apartment to bake everything I need. And I can also have a BJs membership. So Go to BJs. And I can get everything I need in bulk. So like all the flour and butter and sugar and all that stuff. So it's not an issue if I just do it from my apartment. And so I was putting up flyers and trying to promote my business and has really been working on for the last week and a half, and I feel great. And it's amazing. And that's basically it. Alright, so you feel like, everything's kind of going your way. Hmm. And you're really excited about the new business idea. I know that your brother was a little concerned with how much you've been spending on the business idea. And he mentioned some things about different relationships you've had that are new.  Okay, so there's a couple that with that. So with the spending, like I don't think my brother recognizes that when you start a business like you need to invest in it to begin, and I understand why he's worried because like, so at work well at the office job that I had, like I got in trouble and because I obviously you need to make fires and I was like, oh, like he doesn't realize I'm frugal. I'm smart. So I was like I'll make the fires at work. And put them out of the work computer. So that I'm not having to pay like, wherever, like staples or something to go and print them out for me. So I got in trouble because it was like for personal use, and I was using like the, the work, whatever. But like that's what annoys me about it because like the new guy that I met, which is the other thing with the relationships, like this new guy is so supportive of my ideas. I met him actually in a bakery, which is like destiny. And he was so supportive when I told him about what I was planning. And actually the other guy that I was talking to before, and I've been talking to him for a while, he was kind of like my brother and was like, are you sure this is something you want to do? And like, I don't understand why you would say that someone who's obviously sure of what they want to do. Like, I know I can do it. I know that I'll be successful, like, did they not taste the brownies at the bake sale? Like they were amazing. And so that's kind of where I am and that's why my brother's worried but he shouldn't be because like I have all this played out. He's worried that you don't want to think this was the new relationship you don't know the guy too well I mean, I've hooked up with him a few times, like I know him pretty well. And I don't think he understands like the connection that we have, I guess a pretty strong one. So your brother just doesn't. In your mind, he just doesn't get it. No. And like, he doesn't like, pay attention to me when I talk. Like, I'll be trying to tell him about, like the bake sale and or not the bake sale. Well, a little bit about the bake sale, I can try to tell him about how successful it was. And he just thought that I was like, bragging, but I wasn't like it was genuinely, like a success. And then I tried to tell him about my business idea. And like, he's like, trying to like brush it off. Like it's not a good idea. And that's why so he just doesn't listen to me. So sometimes I try not to talk too much about it. Have you noticed through all this, any change in sleep patterns?  I haven't been sleeping as much but I think that's just because I'm so excited about this and like so. I've been like staying up late and waking up early and like looking at recipes, and honestly hasn't really been an issue because I haven't been tired at all. I was really The I haven't eat I felt rested. I get enough. Notice you do feel rested. You haven't been sleeping as much. No And you clearly seem like you're in a good mood No, no sadness right now at that, like I'm not gonna have sadness when you're following your passion should be doing pretty well that way. Have you ever been down or depressed? Yeah, yeah. In the past I have been actually, not too long ago, about four months ago I was I was hospitalized because I was so down. But, you know, and I, I don't feel like that now. And I know what it feels like to be down and I don't have any of that stuff. Like I feel so much more hopeful and happy and just great with where my life is going right now. Do you ever feel this way before? kind of in a really good,  no No. Nothing like this. What do you think about all this one? Honestly I just think it's like getting to know myself and getting to know like what I want to do which is this you know, culinary arts it's kind of realizing that it's kind of changed my life for the better for like really for the better All right, and you mentioned before that you got some trouble at work right? How bad that turned out pretty bad like I it was like a final written notice so if any little thing at this point could make me lose my job but I'm not too worried about it because at this point I'm putting so much time into the baking business that if something goes wrong with my like office job, like I'll have this like in I'm sure that in as short as a month like I'll, I'll be making money soon. And a lot of money because I know how much time I'm going to be putting into this how passionate I am about it. And I know that like I'll be able to make the money back that I've put into it. So I'm not worried about it shouldn't have to worry about that. Yeah. Any medical conditions, you know, have a drug and alcohol you're saving is anything like that?  No Are you seeing or hearing anything that other people can't see or hear? No,  no like that? Sure. So I know that you're feeling pretty well. But I would like you to see a counselor, maybe help you as you contemplate these different things we've been talking about. If you'd be if you'd be okay with talking to a counselor, I guess that'd be fine. You'd be okay with that. I'll get that set up. We'll just take a moment. And I want to thank you for answering my questions. This has been helpful. You're welcome.","The patient's brother has expressed concerns about patient's mood.

47,"Summarize: Except that when you're in work you worry a lot about how you come across in social situations. Yeah, really makes me feel really anxious. Like, what I look like and what people are thinking. Yeah, you said that you worry that you visibly shake. Yeah. And are there any other things that you worry that people will notice? I think obviously the shaking I think my hands and legs shaking and kind of going really red and sweating and just looking great. went ahead. So it sounds like you have quite a strong mental image of how you see yourself when you're in these social situations. Yeah. You say you go read you shake. Is there anything else that you think that you do? I mean, describe yourself. How do you think you look, when you're in these situations, just like, I think I just looked really obviously weird and out of place and like really read and just visibly shaking and sweating and kind of not being able to communicate properly with people. And is there anything that you do to try and kind of defend against these things to manage these problems? And I guess like when I'm holding the camera, I just grip onto it really, really tight, or kind of clench on my muscles and just find something that I can focus on. And to kind of try and make myself shake less and not goes red and stuff. So you focus on something you grip onto that Camera. Do you make eye contact with people? No. I just tend to just look down. Okay, so you also avoid eye contact? Is there anything else that you do to manage the sweating For example,  I just as I like kind of looking down and like wearing all black, so it's less obvious and what kind of worrying? Yeah, just more layers and all black says you just can't tell. Okay What do you think would happen if you stopped doing these things? If you stopped gripping onto the camera? Or, you know, you start to make eye contact and not looking down? And what do you think would happen? I think it would be so much worse. Yeah, I think I just would just check even more and be more anxious and look of more obviously, kind of weird and out of place. And what I'm thinking now is how do you feel about if we did an experiment to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things? If we did a bit of a role play where we pretended to enact a situation at work, okay? And if we did this maybe twice and the first time, you do all the things that you normally do, okay and grip onto something, look down. And is there anything else that you do when you're in these situations, these work conversations to try and cope. And I just kind of all just like fumble and like kind of just clench, whatever, whatever it is, I'm holding just really tight and just make sure I don't make any eye contact at all, just kind of get through it. Okay, so in the first time, I want you to do those things as much as you normally would, in fact, maybe even slightly more than you normally would.  Okay,  and then the second time, I want you to drop doing those things all together.  Okay does that sound okay? try my best. And do you? How would you feel about if we filmed this so you could actually see what you looked like? Okay. Do you have a camera with you that we can video on? Yeah. And there is my phone. Okay. Yeah, yeah, we'll use that in just a sec.  Okay before we do this, then we're just going to fill out this form is because what we're doing now is an experiment. We call it behavioral experiments, see what happens when you change the way that you're behaving?  Right. Okay so the first column says, I need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have, so that our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work, and who should I play if you're playing yourself in this roleplay? Who should I be? maybe like a client at work? I always have to sit down with clients before we did the shoe and kind of get to know a little bit more about what they want. Okay, so would it work if I was maybe having a wedding and I was hiring?  Yeah,  wedding photographer? Yeah. What kind of problems do you see coming up in this conversation that we have like what we see yourself doing on camera I am shaking, like being really obviously shaking and Okay, bright red and Okay, so, visibly shaking. So how, how much will you be shaking if 100 is like shaking uncontrollably and zero is not shaking at all? How visibly shaking Will you be? 90 Okay. So what was the other thing that you just said? like I really read Okay, so go read. Yeah. And how read will you go? I mean, if we look around this room probably like the chairs.  Okay, thanks. Hello. Yeah, you're going to be as kind of brightly pink as these chairs. Oh, yeah. Okay. So out of 100 then how how pink would you say these chairs are 90 have 100 Okay. What else you worried is going to happen when we have these conversations, just worried to be fake, like say something stupid and not be able to kind of get what I'm trying to say across properly. Okay, and how stupid out of 100 100 is ridiculously stupid. Probably like, similar 90. Okay, I'd say wow, see worried will happen when you have this conversation. What else might you see on the camera?  I think you'll probably be able to see that I'm sweating and okay. And how much will you be sweating? Again, 90. I really think like visibly sweating down the face. Yeah. Okay, and what you think will happen the second time around when you stop kind of doing the things you normally do to cope when you maybe start to make eye contact. You're not gripping on something.  I think it will be even worse. I think Oh, yeah. How much worse? slightly worse, like twice as bad?  Twice as bad. Okay. Yeah. Okay, right. Can you give me your phone number? Oh yeah. Should I just use this?  And yeah, yeah, it's probably best. Okay. Okay. okay. So I was just wondering if I could talk to you about maybe doing my wedding photography. Yeah. And what kind of kind of what kind of things you see and how you want it to be like, I suppose I like lots of shots of our family and our friends quite a lot of natural shots. You know, talking when they're having drinks. And yeah. Do you want it? Like, do you kind of see it being outside? Is that something that you're interested in? Yeah, shots there's going to be a summer wedding. So we like I like a lot of outdoors shots and if possible, you know, if it's not raining, that would be quite nice and Yeah, quite some arty ones if that's possible. Yeah. And yeah, that'll be. I've done quite a few things like that before.  So, have you got anything that you could show me about your past work?  Yeah, I recently did some shoots outside kind of in like a word environment so that I could show you that maybe it would kind of help with some ideas.  Okay, great. All right, let's do the second one now. Okay. Okay, you put down the bottle and make eye contact. Okay. Hi. So I was just wondering if I could speak to you about doing my wedding photography. Yeah, yeah. And what kind of thing are you looking at? How do you want it to be like, and I'd like kind of lots of shots of family and friends and quite a lot of natural shots, you know, okay. And are you interested in having things outside maybe and he said it was he wants to It's been natural. Yeah, cuz it's gonna be a summer wedding and Okay, you know, weather dependent. Of course. Yeah, it would be really great if we could kind of get lots of shots you know, outdoors. Okay. Yeah, people chatting and maybe some quite arty ones as well. Yeah. Have you got anything that you could show me about your past work? Yeah, actually, it's kind of a lot of the things I do are outside and I'm really interested in getting natural shots. So when I could change some of my work, and we could kind of see if we could kind of develop something from that could be quite good. Okay.  Let's pause it there. Okay. Ryan's gonna give you this back now to look up. Okay. And I just want you to watch that. Okay. And then we'll chat about it in a moment. Okay. That's weird thing. So, if we just go back to the things that you predicted, then you said that you thought you were going to shake visibly shake. Could you see yourself shaking on a video Definitely not as much as I thought. I think it's obvious that I'm obviously quite anxious, but I don't think you can tell them shaking that much. So you said that you were going to shake 90 out of 100? How much shaking Would you say that you saw there? And maybe like, less than 30. Okay. And you said that you were going to go red, or pink as pink as these chairs? 90 out of 100. Did you notice yourself going pink? Not really. Actually, definitely less than I thought. Yeah, not as much. Okay, you said that you were worried that you were going to say something stupid, you know, at 90 out of 100 Did you know yourself say anything stupid? Not really. Yeah. Yeah, thought was gonna be a lot worse than actually it was. So you thought you were going to be like 90 say something that was 90% stupid. That's really quite strong. I mean, in the end did you pick up in Anything that could be maybe put that as a zero? Maybe like, less than 10 maybe. And you said that you thought you were going to be sweating? Yeah. And that you're going to be visibly sweating. Did you? Did you notice yourself sweating in the end? Not really. Definitely not as bad as I thought again, you thought you were going to be like night out, like seriously visibly sweating. So what what score would you actually give it in the end? Maybe again, less than 10 I don't think you could tell at all. Mm hmm. You also said that you thought it was going to be twice as bad when you stop choosing your you know your normal strategies. Yeah. What did you notice watching that video? It was actually probably better when I wasn't doing any of those things. I think I looked a lot more natural. And I was able to say what I was trying to say. I think it just come across more personable when I'm not kind of looking down and stuff. okay that's all for now. Thank you so much for your time","The patient worries a lot when in social situtations, visibly shake, red and sweating. The patient tries to clench on their muscles and find something to focus on or look down and they prefer wearing black to be less obvious of worrying. The therapist requests the patient for a role-play of these situations to be enacted. On enacting the patient rates 90 on 100 for all her symptoms by doing those things she normally would. The patient believes they are going to do a lot worse if they don't do things they normally do to cope with their anxiety. After enacting, the patient feels much better and rates less than 30 for visibly shaking, less than they thought for going red, less than 10 for being stupid, less than 10 for visibly sweating. The patient felt much better and looked more natural after watching themselves in the video when they weren't doing any of those coping up things. "

Or is it mostly you yelling? Are you both yelling? I feel like I have to get my point across. But he's not 100% innocent and messy. And I'm like, it's not my fault.

50,"Summarize: Tiffany how you doing today? Nice,  I understand you've been having some recent difficulties. I think with the cups. There's some involvement with the place It was so blown out of proportion. Stupid neighbors were having a party. I'm trying to get sleep. It's like, you know, 1011 I'm trying to why now they're having a party. I go over there, you know, at the door through the door. Yo, I'm trying to get sleep. Bring it down some no response. So I let myself in. With little forest by myself in there. I'll just confirm who's ever there who's having this party. Everybody's just like, everybody's ignoring me. So I just go over take the stairs. Are you open the window, throw it out the window. Then there may have been people walking by. This woman swear she was walking by says I almost I almost hit her. But to me that she called cops. So what story are you on? Maybe third floor, third floor. So you threw the stereo out the window. And it was nowhere near that woman. She was way across the street but she says almost rehearsal. She called whom? she called the police said I was out of control and then the people from the party had a nerve to go down. When the cops got there and they agree with her they said came they sound broken and I just came in But anyway, Mesa other stereo and then the police are Brenton and put me in jail and they're threatening to press charges and now it's just ugly but it's blown out of proportion.  You feel it's blown out proportion? Yes. Is anything like this happened before? Not with the police or anything how about anything were you found your anger? Strong? Well, maybe there was the time it was my daughter. She's 16 years old. You know how teenagers are? They don't listen. She wasn't listening. She has a smartphone brand new smartphone she got for Christmas, you know out of my money from my pocket. Brand new smartphone got for Christmas up here. Hello Is tuffrey homework. Did you do your homework? She says Gavin on the phone. Not listening. Took the phone. Throw it out the window. Broke shattered. Yeah. How long ago was this with a thumb four five months ago for five months. All right. So do you find that you're angry often. I want to say I'm angry often. I just think is if people did what I wanted them to do what I wanted to do them to do it I have gone in be so upset as much so you find yourself upset on occasion on occasion but again it's just if people would listen I don't know if it was last year your before 101 it was like it was one of those Thanksgivings and just my whole family's around you know Thanksgiving much about our cooking dinner. Busy all in the kitchen. Everything's hot when I've got this whole warming meal me. My brother's there, his family's there. You know, my husband's family's there. Everybody's there. Everybody's time to eat. Everybody's time to eat. I think this football game is more interested in my food. I spent all day making this. So it's like, you know, just went to TV. Thought about my brother. He's 45 years old. He should be listening you know? But just throw it on the ground Smash.

That's why you're here. Everything like I says there's no need for police No need. For now they're involved and you feel like counseling may be helpful. If I want to keep my job, yes, I can't go to jail. I'm like, I can't face any charges. I can't do that. So counselor would be helpful in that regard. I don't see it as a problem. You don't see the anger as a problem? Oh, see what everybody's talking about. My husband says, I have these anger issues. My kids say, throw a temper tantrum like a two year old. But I will say I will see it. You're just gonna say it. I don't see it. Do you have any history of medical problems? mental health problem? Do you ever use drugs or alcohol? No, nothing like that.

What kind of thoughts are you being distracted toward if I have somewhere to go on things About You know, getting in the car and driving and you know the possibility of being in another accident I just a lot of my thoughts seem to focus on one being in my car and just the accident I can't seem to shake that. So tried to kind of push the thoughts aside and then they're still there. Yeah. in trouble sleeping. I'm somewhat I don't have any trouble getting to sleep but I have trouble staying to wake up several times a night. yeah How about your relationship with other people you feel there's the same distance or do you feel closer or more detached well My mom is probably the person I'm closest to. And I haven't really wanted to spend a lot of time with her anymore. I'm really just staying in the house and just stay into myself. about dreams, a change in dreams like the events of the accident come up. Well, one one night there was this dream that stuck out to me. I was driving home from work. And I was just about to get on the highway. And I heard sirens coming. And I stopped to see where the sirens were going and they got closer and closer to me and they seem to surround me and I was like, wait, what's going on? And I woke up and I was like, Oh my gosh, what I you know, I was I felt like I was right back there. In that moment where I was in a car accident and the police responded to the accident but it was so much more intensified. Like, you know, I've never had a dream like that before. And when you woke up It sounds like you were alarmed not want to stress was Does that ever happened when you weren't asleep and said like a dream? Have you ever had a moment where you're kind of back in the car accident? You know in the cars accidents happening, like it feels like you're really back there maybe once or twice but not sure do have any medical problems? No nothing going on. And the use of drugs or alcohol, No nothing like that. Do you remember all the details of the accident? Or do you feel like there's pieces of memory that are missing? I really can't remember the details. I just know about him. I don't know. I don't. I can't remember back to what happened. And people keep asking me and I just, I can't remember at all. Really what happened. So some memory loss surrounding that. Yeah, definitely. Do you ever have or, or since the symptoms have come on? Do you ever feel like you're not really yourself, you're separated from yourself kind of unreal experience or you're separated from the world, either one of those. Feel like that. Okay. Jessica, based on our conversation here, I'm going to set you up to see a counselor if that's something you're open to. And I want to thank you for taking the time to tell me what happened and answer my questions. It's been very helpful.  Thank you. Thanks.

52,"Summarize: Today I've been working still on the fear of leaving the home for extended periods of time like vacation. And it's been a little harder recently because I have this plan trip with a friend of mine coming up in a few months and that's kind of been weighing on my mind. Whereas the trip to? Georgia how long way she wants to go like six days Yeah, I'm not sure with work and school and everything I can make the full six days and plus I'm a little nervous to go that long. So that's a long time for you. It is yes. So when did you discover this trip was going to be actually last Just a few days ago, she messaged me and said, Hey, you want to go with me and we'll go golfing and swimming. I love golfing. Like, I know I want to go. But I just had these just a little nervous about leaving a little nervous? So when she made that call,  I was just a couple days ago, was the first thought he had kind of I can't go that long. That was my first thought. That's, that's too long. But he was like, wow, this would be great. I want to go down there golfing so bad and get away from the cold weather. So I mean, my immediate thought was no, not that long. But yes, I'm gonna go. Alright, so so to kind of conflicting thoughts, right. So one, one is like, never go that long, six days, way too long. And the other one is that would be enjoyable. You enjoy that?  Absolutely. Yeah. So which way you're leaning right now. I want to go to go for six days. Maybe just like a long weekend 3, 4 days? two would be ideal but the idea of it two three days Yeah. So what we think is causing this worry about being gone more than two days? I don't know. I mean, I've always as a late teenager in my 20s I've always had just nervous to leave home I don't as much as I love being home I love to travel to and you know, do different things. It's just, I guess I'm just afraid something to happen when I'm not around. Not to you're afraid something will happen to your, your house or, well, I have pets so we're about them. My parents are getting older, so I worry about them. Mainly, like my immediate family, mainly, I guess my dad, because he's had a history of heart attacks and then my pets that's such as for something to happen, I will be there. And how about when you were younger? You said this Problems found for was the same thing, the same thing. So mostly family and now some pets, my pets then to see if that's yes, your feelings are there fighting one another. Absolutely. And right now the feeling the thought anyway, have you know I would like to go on the trip. is winning But the fear thought was kind of dragging, dragging you down. Yeah. So what's the sensation of anxiety here? Yeah, I get anxious. Yeah, my heart gets feels like it's heavy my chest feels heavy and I just all these thoughts go through my mind like, you know, I know my parents um I can watch my pets but they may not take care of them like I would I don't know it's just I mean that you know they've always will take care of all my no but they'll miss me and they might tear my house up I don't all these thoughts in my mind that seem crazy to me. So it seems like an endless stream of worries. Yeah. Surrounding family and pets. And what might happen. So really, that's that's it, right? This is what might happen. It's the uncertainty, right? So is anything ever happened? No, no Okay. So so far all worrying. And anxiety really hasn't paid me dividends. Yes. And now that I'm older when I was younger, I probably wouldn't like it overnight. But now that I'm older yes, I do I just say, I got to live my life and they'll be okay. I just try to tell myself they're in good hands. If something happens somebody Oh, call me but then I feel like oh, but I want to be hours away. I'm a plane ride away. And then I get thinking about that, but I do go.  But you didn't in the past no So something changed. What changed? I don't know.I really right? So not sure what change but used to not go, now you do go. So when you're down there, or wherever you go in the trip, you're feeling better, like you're enjoying yourself. But you're also worried at the same time. Not too well. Once I get there, I'm usually okay. Maybe the first night I get a little worried. And then maybe when I'm getting ready to come home, I'm like a little anxious, I'm ready to get home to make sure everything's okay. And the rest of the time. I'm usually Okay. I'll get some alcohol involved. So he kind of limits my anxiety. But once I get into like playing the golf and all that, I really do allow myself to enjoy it. It's just it seems like it's going and coming. That's alright, so the problem really isn't when you're there. The problem is now leading up to it and maybe just the first half day, your day when you're there, and maybe the last half day or two there. It's like a plane. Like I don't have a problem, right, like flying out. But it's the thinking like, while I'm waiting for the plane like, Whoa, what if we What if a terrorist is on there? What if we crash? I'll think about all that before, but once I'm there and on the plane is right, take off. I'm fine. I'm completely fine. not anxious. It's leading up to the actual event that makes me anxious. I suppose anticipation. So that's that's the worst part. All right, so the period between now when you leave, it's gonna be the worst part.  Yes,  but she'll probably stock up. Probably. But I'll have changed my mind probably a dozen times before actually say yes. And when you do go on Twitter. Yeah. something could happen. Certainly sure. But it Hasn't so far I don't know. I try not to think that for alright, so you'll, you'll return? Yeah. Still doesn't stop me from worrying when I get these trips planned. Yeah, so the probabilities of it really doesn't. That doesn't alleviate the Worry, worry still there. Right. Even though you know the worry is probably going to transition to enjoyment and looking forward to that that doesn't  No not at all that doesn't leave anything at all. like I gotta get my house cleaned up and make sure my animals or everyday have enough food and I preparing to leave. Preparing is productive, right? Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Well, how would the thoughts see you feel more connected to the warring? Probably like, like, I want to, I want to say, I don't know I really it's kind of a word. Like I want to, like I can't say bye Not to my parents or I can't, you know, say bye enough to my pets like I feel like I like I don't I don't know, I don't really care. That's, I guess part of the problem. I don't know what I'm connecting it to. So if you don't tell them goodbye enough time. Yeah, I don't know, maybe I sound so. Oh, it sounds like maybe if you don't say if you don't say goodbye enough times and settled that, that you'll feel guilty if something happens maybe that you regret it  maybe. so that so that's the focal point of this thing's night in some way. Right? Let me go for a few days. And the way you start to let go is when you tell them Yeah. So So what do you find yourself doing? You say goodbye and then then leave and then come back? Or do I just finally say, bye? I'll talk to you later love you. You know, I'll check in when I land or whatever and then that's it. Then it's like, I just have to try to breathe and just put those thoughts behind me. Because once I say it, it's like, Okay, that's it. I'm gone. But you're but your thoughts are still coming thoughts are still come in and say, You should have said, goodbye one more time. No. I just know that doesn't come to my mind that you didn't say goodbye well enough. I don't know. The property was the property of saying goodbye. This you feel like you're not doing well enough. Maybe it's just the fact that I'm leaving. I shouldn't leave. say that, you know, maybe I feel like I maybe it's just the guilt of leaving. So the act of leaving itself Leave shoot guilty. And what are you guilty of? Not being there if something happens. So abandon maybe for a short time neglecting them for a short time. Probably maybe I did feel a little guilty. And now you're in more of a caregiver role than you were then. Maybe a little bit I mean, I've always been. I'm the youngest of mine, me and my sister, but my parents have always looked up to me to be the responsible one and make sure everything's taken care of so I probably kind of loud myself. To take on that role of the caregiver moreso or be at the more responsible one of the two. So to be the responsible one, there needs to be guilt when you leave, I guess maybe I should stay home and be responsible person and they don't make me feel guilty. They say go have a good time. Your baby's ugly. Okay, we'll take care of what I mean. I know they're in good hands. That's that's what's makes it so difficult. I know they'll be okay. But I just feel like a probably shouldn't go. So there's not another person driving the skill towards you. That's me. Just coming in from the side. Yeah. So if I, if I leave, well, I'm responsible. And if I leave, something bad will happen. And that'll be on me. Now when they're to fix it, or take care of it or make it better, like I put it on somebody else that have to do with that. Yeah. So fear of being caught as irresponsible. Maybe Yeah. And you could be a few left to just take you a day's travel or whatever, however far away.  Yeah. Right. So yeah, but that's that's still doesn't help relieve anxiety now when you come back, because  no, not really. Because it's like, I want immediate access. Like, I want to be able to be right there within minutes if they need me. Have you ever taken a trip that was like within I mean, not it's not as bad but yeah, there's back there. Stay with us. For an overnight there's some of the way up sometimes I'm thinking I should just stay home. Or I could be right in the same town sometimes that if I'm, I wake up at five in the morning, I just get up and go home because I just get really start feeling really anxious and I want to be home. So the closer you are, it helps a little bit, it sounds like a good part of the anxiety is still there. So it really doesn't matter where you go. It's the fact that you're not home. The fact that you're not able to fully be responsible in the way that you view it. When I work 12 hour shifts and I have to work the overnight I will most of the time Take my break and go there between the chuck on Pima Benson. So at 20 that's a long shift. So a 20 hour shift. At what point do you become anxious when did when you start to notice those thoughts? Probably usually like six, seven hours into it just depends like now it's getting dark so when it kind of gets dark and If I don't leave the light on or something, I get a little anxious. I feel like I need to go home and leave the light on and, you know, just let my pets know I'm coming back kind of weird, but I know they miss me. And then but if I'm busy, then I don't really think about it. So if you know if I'm busy at work, doing something I don't really think about until I stop what I'm doing right, slow down and I'm thinking, wow, I got 10 more hours or eight more hours. Sometimes I go home, sometimes they don't. Sometimes it's worse than others. Right So if you're busy at work, the same reality exists, meaning your pets are alone. But the way you're responding to it is different. Yeah, you're less anxious. Maybe because I know I'm close. I can get there. I know I'm in control. We'll be able to go there. Well, I'm buddy let's say not at work, let's say when you're on the vacations in those days in the middle when you're enjoying yourself. Is that a distraction like the more you enjoy yourself the last year yeah. But the same reality exists there alone. So really, it's your way ofwhich way of viewing things that's leading to anxiety. It's not necessarily what's actually happening. It's my perception, your perception of what's happening. What could happen. I guess in this case, not so much what is happening is what you worried. could could  definitely,  because nothing's happened yet. No, not yet. So, how many? Well, there's I guess there's a few different. There's a few different issues here. Right? How many vacations you take a year. I don't really take long vacations I've taken only I've only taken like two week long vacations ever. For like, five, six days, and I was fine. Well, same anxiety when I was younger. And now it's more like long weekends or you know a night here or there I don't really take long vacations but probably maybe three or four times a year I'm like go away overnight versus just not just a friend's house like an actual vacation where I go into the city or something sort of small proportion of the time so just looking in terms of probabilities you risk is very low because you're not quite that much. But the other issue is that even at work you're still having the same feelings and even for short trips you're still have the same feelings. So you're really limiting things xietymuch of the time Yeah, ' it's been this way for years probably since a teenager and he hasn't stopped me I've always where every now I work more than ever I'm the more it doesn't stop me from working the kind of overtime working three jobs doesn't stop me and but I mean, like I said in as a teenager early 20s it did I would just be like, on my way out somewhere to go stay the night my boyfriend was like, Nope, I can't do it not to come home. But now that doesn't happen. And may not I may not go for a week long vacation, but I'll go for a few nights. So you're functioning? Oh, yeah. ' Approved. Yeah, he's actually pretty good. working a lot sounds like Yeah. Because this uncomfortable anxiety. This is painful for you. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't like so it doesn't really seem to stop me from working obviously, because I work it's just the leading up to leaving for work or going on vacation. Alright, so let's say Well think about making sure I have everything I need for work, you know, don't have, I usually take my dinner. Do you feel less anxious when you With those prevention, okay, so that helps. Right? So physically preparing your house so that your pets are safer that helps you. So what else is going through your mind so you do that right you take all the precautions you can to keep them safe and prepare your dinner for work and everything. So what's the next thought? Just gotta go to work. I just think about I'll come home later. You know if I get a break. I mean usually I do especially if I do the overnight as I got downtime, so run home and check on and then I'm off to work and then I kind of forget about it. And then I said some lights is burned out not every night I come home and check off but some nights I just get started feel anxious and get thinking about them and I go on the trip. So every time when you felt anxious and you wanted to check on them, but you couldn't leave  for now from out working with clients. Yeah, so what happens then terms of thinking and feeling? I don't dwell on it because my focus is with the client. So it just kind of think about it, I need to get home but you know, and I just focus back on the client, I don't let it overwhelm me or Well, just so it doesn't change your function, but society has their anxiety associated with it goes away. I mean, I want what I'm thinking about, but then it goes away. Alright, so depending on what you're thinking about, that can change the level of anxiety you're experiencing. there's something or Yeah. Okay, so there's that is the that is the thought you're having something like that about older cats. I mean, he's really old something cool. You know what if, you know he's, something's happened to hell I mean, I don't honestly thinking I'm dying, but I think you know what he needs because he has he's really old. So I do think about him. I still have that you have that thought like, Yes. So you can see the power of thinking and all this right. So the reality of your cat's health and well being hasn't changed the way you view it, as change the way you think about it. So we talked about before this idea of the adaptive response, right? So the thoughts you're having now that lead to the anxiety, we believe could lead to anxiety. They're automatic, right? They're just popping in your head. Right? It's triggered by certain things, like getting ready to leave for work and, and being at work while and look at the time and realizing something. We have the cats, right. But that's an automatic that just comes without, like, you can't necessarily stop right? just comes naturally when I'm getting ready to leave. Then the anxiety is right there. So the adaptive response, we also call self talk. That's, that's a thought that you can give that you can create consciously. Right? You can think to yourself, so it's not automatic. It's not an adjustment of an automatic thought. It's a thought that you can deliberately think Almost like repeating a sentence that you've memorized, you can at will choose to do that. That makes sense. So I want to make sure I draw the distinction. Some thoughts just pop in. Other thoughts you deliberately, like, when we found is if you have a thought that you deliberately think we call the adaptive response. It can counter the feelings caused by the automatic thoughts, essentially.  You're challenging, you're disputing that automatic thought, this be my own thoughts. You're just spinning your thoughts. Yeah. So, you know, and I want you to work with me to develop these adaptive responses. I want you to have most of the site all the sites you want and because I think that you can develop ones that are useful to you, but just to give an example when you haven't thought that You know, the older cat can be sick, right? And adaptive response could be or could be wide, wide variety of thoughts, but one could be it's not likely. Right? Like, you know, or if it is likely that you know, he'll probably be okay. If it's a he or she, okay? He'll probably be okay till I get home. Another adaptive response could be it would be sad and unfortunate something happened. But I have my work responsibilities and at some point I have to leave the cats alone. I do tell them that I tell them thank them and I feel like them that well does someone want sometimes I run from me when I try to kiss them goodbye. And I'm like, Oh, no, what I have to go to work because you will have to eat. I know it sounds silly, but I do tell him that and then I kind of thinks it does. Most things. I think I didn't realize that's kind of what I was. But I do do that sometimes. So you're actively responding. Yeah, but I didn't realize that's what I was doing. But yeah, I do say that to myself to them. Yeah. Well, I think that's a productive, adaptive response. I mean, you know, you're right. If you don't, if you don't earn income, then they'll have worse problems.  Yeah, I can't take care of them being left alone.  So really good working. You're, you're being more of service to them and protecting them more so Yeah, that's true. I never thought of it that way. So that might be one adaptive response you may want to consider applying when you have this, this feeling of anxiety and then there's times I think, you know, they're just cats are probably the last to go on. So they're not striking you as anxious when you get home. Yeah. Well, sometimes sometimes sometimes after a 12 hour shift, yes, I have one of them. She won't show me let me sleep the first hour, she literally were around again and stuff. And I take it and she's mad because I've been gone, but she's fine. She continues to survive, despite being perhaps upset with you for leaving. So that could be another adaptive response that they may be enduring a mild stressor. But sometimes they're asleep when you get home. So  yeah, that's true. how bad could it be for them? Yeah. And they don't know. I'm worrying or anxious. They could care less like they don't believe no, it's not bothering them. I mean, yeah, I mean, their level awareness clearly different than than yours. Right. So yeah, I mean, that's another good adaptive response that, you know, much higher level awareness, whereas you're not sure that Have any awareness that you're experiencing anxiety? Or maybe a little bit with a one cat who runs or think they do?  And that's just an animal person but I think they do but yeah, I probably give them think they have more feelings than what they probably really do. But they're my kids I treat them as kids my kids are all gods are important too. Yeah, absolutely. So it's understandable that you would be anxious and have concerns and but it also seems like you did make preparations to elevate their chances of having a successful experience right being okay. Yeah. So you implement behaviors that are practical and that I've worked in making the house safe and keeping the plants away from them and so I think one route here if you're okay with it would be to use work as like the first point I know you have the trip. I know that's, that appears to be causing more anxiety than thinking the worst But you have more chances? Well, one way you have more chances to test out these step responses at work because it's more or less a daily thing, right? five days a week, or whatever it is. So some of those adaptive responses that we kind of worked on together, right? You could apply those. And you know, think about that the responses are not always short. Right? The automatic thoughts could be short. It can even be images, do not necessarily even complete sentences, right? Like maybe have an image of your cat in an unfortunate situation. So it's not necessarily spelled out in English, like a sentence, but adaptive responses. Well, they could be images too, but the ones I'm talking about are really sentences that you're repeating back consciously to yourself. So it's important to have them prepared and ready to go. So I often ask clients To kind of write them out and have them available. So that when that thought comes about, and it seems like you're pretty good at identifying, you know, what thoughts are triggering anxiety you would read eventually would have to read because you've memorized initially you'd read the automatic thought I mean, the upside of the adaptive response and that would counter the deal on that thought. Okay, might not the first time might not the second time but over time we believe it and I found that it changes how often and how intense to aback thoughts come in. Conscious thinking, adaptive responding, does that make sense? That's us. Because like I said, I kind of said these things to myself anyway, I just didn't realize that's what was probably lessening the anxiety because I do say that things those things to myself pretty frequently when I say I have to go to work, or else you guys won't be able to take care of didn't even dawned on me that that's you've already adapted Yeah, you've already used cognitive behavioral techniques, in a way to reduce anxiety. So what we're really doing is just expanding and formalizing what you've already been doing to achieve some success. That makes sense. Definitely, yes. So, if you could, between now and next session, write down some of the adaptive responses that we discussed the ones you've already used and, and then work to identify the automatic thoughts at work, and then come up, work to identify them, and then consciously repeat those, those that the responses back when you have those thoughts, okay, so you're really repairing self talk, adaptive responses, with the automatic thoughts, that thought comes right? And then you have the adaptive response. And you're repeating it, you know, it's an internal, you're pitting and just thinking it unnecessarily odds out loud, although, that would surely be okay to not know, your coworkers, you know, respond something like that. Sorry. No. I mean, I've threatened to put a camera in the house. So I can like, there's a thing you can, you can remote access to your house, and there's a button your animal can push and call you. And I've talked to him at work. I'm like, Well, my cat calls me y'all. I really thought about it seriously, that I could check one that would lessen my anxiety would have to go home, I could just look in and see what they're doing. I have thought that some of my co workers know I can't worry about them. So yeah, they would help support me and not be so anxious. Probably. Yeah. And and putting in a security type measure. You could lessen anxiety, or it could create anxiety, but make it worse, and I don't know which, you know. So I think if you're okay with it, we'll start with the adaptive responses.  Yeah, I'd rather do that.  See how that works out. And we have other options. Putting security systems in such to shy out in the future if necessary. Let's try the adaptive responding. Then trying to keep track of how well it works for you like, what your what your thoughts and feelings were. After you applied it, should I like try to measure my level of anxiety? Absolutely. Okay. Yeah. So you know, maybe like a one to 10 with 10 being the worst, okay, and measure it when you first had that experience of it. I'm pretty sure you can measure fairly accurately, you've experienced it for a long time. You suffer with it for a long time. And then after applying the adapter response, especially after a few minutes, applying a few times, maybe shoot for ones, see what it is that and note that, again, the beginning of might not see much of a change at all. Right? So be persistent with it. Okay. Give it a chance to work and see how it does. Okay. We'll start there and we'll kind of review how you do that. And then we'll work toward the things Analyze the bigger stressor right? And we'll see what we can do in terms of planning adaptive responses for that. Okay. So a good plan. Yes.","The patient has difficulty leaving home for extended periods of time like vacation. The patients explains a scenario where they are seen to have conflicting thoughts of to go and not to go. The patient has parents and pets to take care of. The patient gets worried if something might happen to them when they are away. The patient feels less anxious if they are busy at work since they can reach home but not the same during a vacation. The therapist confirms, depending on what the patient thinks, it can change the level of anxiety. The therapist advises to use self talk to overcome automatic thoughts of anxiety and discusses adaptive responses useful to the patient. The patient is asked to develop different adaptive responses and read the upside of adaptive response to counter the automatic thought and is requested to try this week and note the adaptive responses down. The therapist also request the patient to measure their anxiety levels."

Did that? I guess my gambling and my promiscuity? Um, you know, like, for instance, well, I mean, this one friend from high school was were really close. And I ended up getting with her boyfriend when they were together. But I mean, people forgive each other, like, what's the big deal, and she couldn't get over it. And then the other my other friend got mad at me for that because they slept with their boyfriend, but I was drunk. And, I mean, I was gambling that night. So really, who cares, but I don't know. And then I would post on Facebook and just constantly post Just about different guys or that it was gambling and that it was winning. You know, I didn't I think it turned some people off, I guess but I don't know why it was it was just having a good time. And was this all back in high school?

There was like eight of us and a group of girlfriends And how about now? I don't have any of those friends. How many close friends do you have? I don't I don't I don't really have any close friends.

For men. There's, there's there's a lot like 10 that I see fairly regularly. Yeah. Can you describe to me your relationship with these? These 12 acquaintance? Um, well, the women at work like I usually just tell them about like my fun, you know, times that I'm like gambling and meeting men and you know them buying me things and me buying them thinks I'm winning all this money. And then I usually go back to work and tell them that You know, I don't have any money left because I used it all, you know, first, because I'm gambling second because I want to show off for the guys and just the thrill of it. So that's just usually what I talk to them about. And the men usually are just that I encounter a while gambling or shopping or when I'm drinking, and I could just meet them just at you know, the the blackjack table or whatever. I could just leave them there. Or just online. So you mentioned social media before, can you tell me about your interaction on social media? I'm actually enjoy social media a lot. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's, it's great. It's a great outlet, especially when you have a lot of ideas and you just want to get it out there. And I think that it's really great for me to express my ideas and stuff like that. I'm just going through and so I use it. A lot. Hold on. I do. Yeah. And especially when I'm out like, I mean, I don't know if you're familiar with like, like Facebook and tweeting or Twitter.

I just will post about, like, my night, or just a cool idea I had about just starting a business or anything like that. Yeah, and I'll post a lot. And like Twitter, it's pretty much like every two minutes because it's super fast. So I'll do that, like every two minutes when I'm out. So a lot of people follow or read the posts? Oh, they do. A lot of people doing some people think oh, that's a great idea. And then like, you know, an hour later, they're just like, hurry. Like, is everything okay? Like, are you fine? You know, I quickly unfriend them. Because they're not like following what I'm saying. And then I have people that unfriend me because they don't like them post thing all the time, but really that's what it's there for. And it's there for me to express myself. And if they can't handle it, then well how about I want to ask you about interests like sports, music, the arts, television, you have any you mentioned social media seems like an interest and the other interests like hobbies like interests. I like shopping. I love shopping. Going away. I like vacationing in nice places. I'm how about talents?

So that's it really you feel like people, like people you mentioned that would see you on social media or your acquaintances, do you feel like they understand you? you know, because they've all friended me, so I guess they don't understand me.

56,"Summarize: Good afternoon, Bruce. I'm glad you could make it in today. Thanks for coming in. Last week when you were you had come in because you had had a positive urine analysis test for marijuana. And so we were working on ways that you could cut down or extinguish marijuana use altogether. And how did you feel about our talk last week? It was okay, I guess. Yeah. Just okay. Yeah. All right. Okay, so I want to refresh your memory and I've got my notes here. Do you mind if I refer to my notes?  okay yeah. Yeah, I wasn't in the mood. I'm wondering what you could have done in the world. I'm not sure what I could have done. And so because of the not exercising, did it make any difference in your marijuana usage this week? Yeah, it was used a bit more. Okay. Okay. So how would you tie those two things together By not running? I think the mix when I'm not exercising, generally I would turn to the more usage. Yeah, yeah. So when you reflect back now on last week, and the rain coming down, and it was cold, I'm wondering if there was a way that you could change your perception about that, such that it wouldn't stop you from running. What do you think? Yeah To change the perception above, maybe wear a rain jacket or something. Mm hmm, that would be a great idea. That would be an excellent idea. Well, I tried to stay away, but I didn't. I still saw some of them. So it was it was difficult to cut them out of your life? Last week? Yeah. And  you tell me more but what was difficult about it, the stuff that they think something badly of the I didn't want them to think  You know, avoiding the raising. So you did it sounds like you didn't want to hurt their feelings. Yes by them thinking that you were going to avoid them. yes And so as a result of this what what happened? Well, I just ended up going to see them and then hanging out.And, yeah. So because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them, you ended up using marijuana. Is that correct? Yeah. And I'm wondering how you could do that differently this week. Well, I could, I suppose I could just try hard enough to go and see you guys. And what would that involve trying harder not to go see them? Hmm. Yeah. Sometimes it is that simple is just making that commitment. yourself and just drawing the line. And do you have any friends that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with? Yes i do, I don't feel that often, but I could, I could start to see that more.  Okay. How about motivated on a scale of one to 10? Would you say you are to kind of reignite friendships with people that don't smoke pot? Three. Okay. So you're still, you're still a little iffy about you about whether you want to associate with those friends again, but I have to ask you, Bruce, what do you what made you say three instead of one? Well, because I know for all, so I feel like I need to, I think I should start doing something about it. I think that's great insight that you're able to see that moving towards The friends that don't smoke pot and making the effort to do that is actually going to enhance your life incredibly. And when you associated with the friends that didn't smoke pot in the past, what kind of things did you do? Like what what kind of things activities and things? Yeah. Was it fun to be with them? Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, we just mostly are like doing some outdoor activities, maybe just sort of get some pressure kind of thing. Usually it's not so like, you know, there's more. They tend to do more healthy activities, I would say. So you can recall living a healthier life then and having fun outdoors and basically having a healthier life overall, without using the pot. Yeah You're right there. It could be I might take my mind off of it. Sometimes it's good to remember having those good times with the friends that didn't smoke the pot because it makes you realize that you don't really need it. And I think that's a great, I think that's a great idea. Was I really had a lot of second thoughts. I was worried about commitment and that kind of thing. So I didn't feel like that was the right the right idea. Okay, so you had some second thoughts about that. You're excited about it and last week's session, but after you had a chance to reflect upon it, you kind of realized that it wasn't getting a dog was not the best Thanks for you,  a lot of commitment and a lot of time that I just don't have the motivation to be putting in. I think that's wise to recognize that right up front, I'm given the research on pets any kind of pet, and how it helps people sustained from alcohol and drug usage. I'm wondering if there is another option that you might consider.  Maybe. What do you have in mind? I'm thinking, do you like pets that aren't don't require such a commitment? That's a good idea. I didn't think about that. Because a dog is the dog is a large commitment. Yeah. You know, there's all kinds of animals, snakes or fish or something. Hey, snakes ! fish, that would definitely be a star these animals that you like.  Yeah.  All right, I think it's important that you have an animal that you like and that you can relate to. Alright, so in the final goal was to find and join a support group for people that were trying to be abstinent from marijuana. How did you make out with that? I look into it. But like, I went to the first the first meeting, and I just felt like, like, those people were bought on the barrel and I was just not I just didn't fit in with that crowd where they are not in that place. So you made the effort to go and you went I couldn't, I just didn't want to stay. And so you didn't stay the whole time. Right. And so you left early because you felt you didn't feel and you they were the bottom of the barrel and you're still higher functioning. Yeah I can definitely understand I'm wondering if there is any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you. what Do you think? See there could be some positive. I just don't I don't I just don't see it that much at this point. And what might be some positives that you would get out of the support group? Well, I would, I would probably be able to relate to people in the same kind of situation. And maybe it's just a positive to be able to have connection with people like that. I'm not sure. So you're you're saying that the past of being in a support group would be that you'd get a chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey, and to have connections with other people. And again, I can send you information that will show you that that just these two items alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pot, but from increasing the feel good hormones in your body, the connection and the relating to other people. It might be similar when you were younger, you had mentioned last week that you were a hockey player. And so you had support that was sort of like the team was sort of like a support group. I'm wondering if you could relate to people in head connections and wondering if you could see a support group as a team. Yeah, it would probably be the same kind of situation like Essentially, people in a support group are all there for the same goal. So it's kind of like in hockey. Very important there to win. Mm hmm. And do you remember when you were playing hockey, how it felt to be encompassed in that team?  Yeah, it was good.  It gave. And that's because of those good feeling hormones that come in neurotransmitters that come throughout your body when you have those connections. So how committed do you think you are? If I were to send you a list of support groups? So you could try out some others? Where there weren't the bottom of the barrel? As you say, there? how committed Do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week? Probably eight, or 10. Yeah. Wow. What made you say an eight rather than a four, five was just a team analogy, I think is a good analogy. So you thought How you remembered. You remember how you felt when you were on the team and how it gave you that sense of connection? Yeah. And also, you know, I don't have to be the mean, if, if I think of it as a team, maybe I would be like the star on the team, because I'm not quite so bottom of the barrel. Maybe I love that analogy. Good thinking. It's thinking, Bruce. That's excellent. Wow. Well, just to summarize, today, you came in, you had made some progress, but you had some stumbling blocks. You have decided that whether it's rain or shine, you're going to run anyway, because you're going to have you raincoat and you're going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than the friends that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting it Dog, you're going to look into getting a snake or what was the other thing?  Oh, fish. Yeah.  Okay. And in terms of a support group, I will send you a list of support groups. And you feel that on a scale of one to 10, that you're about an eight, and actually carrying through and trying out two of these support groups, because of the hockey team analogy. Great job. So overall, how would you rate today's session?  It was good, very good. And if we were to put it on a scale of one to 10, eight out of eight. All right, we did get in if we did an eight. All right,  way to go. Thanks. All right. Thanks","The patient has had a positive urine test analysis for marijuana. The therapist and patient were working on ways to cut down or extinguish marijuana altogether. The patient did not exercise by running because it was raining and this resulted in more usage of marijuana. On therapist's nudge, the patient agrees they could use a raincoat and ensure they go for running. They did not want to hurt their friends' feelings and hence ended up hanging out with them and using marijuana. The patient rates three out of ten for motivation to meet friends who don't use marijuana. The patient recalls outdoor activities and healthy lifestyle with these friends. The therapist discusses another option to take a pet and is left to patient to decide on the animal they can relate to. The therapist clarifies the postive effects of support group in improving abstinence, and brings analogy with a hockey team as the patient plays hockey. The patient rates eight on ten of attending a support group. The patient rates the therapy session as eight on ten. "
57,"Summarize: So Tommy, I wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures from a party you were at and made me a little bit concerned because I saw you were drinking and I wonder if you can tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits in your life. I mainly just drink whenever I'm at parties or whenever somebody hands me a beer i'll i'll take sips every now and then. But it's not something that I feel hovers around my life. It's kind of a social thing for you not like a major priority. Yeah. How much do you think you're drinking? I guess I would say like every other every other weekend, maybe every every two weeks. On occasion, maybe There's a basketball game going on or a football game I'll have a beer just to drink with my boys. But other than that, I don't really see it as much of a of a problem. So you're drinking maybe half the time depending on what's going on that weekend. Yeah, I guess you can say that. Well, how would you describe the difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you don't? When I'm not drinking, I'm usually more like, involved in doing like more productive things like I I try and do more schoolwork whenever I have the time or whenever I like I can go workout or something just to like, when whenever I'm drinking, I devote my time to just letting loose and having fun and just relaxing with friends. Okay, so you you feel like you get more stuff done on weekends. When Don't drink, but maybe you don't feel like you can relax as well. Yeah, I mean, I, whenever I'm drinking, I know that I'm devoting time to, to not doing other things. So I try and make it so that I don't allow myself to pile on so much work. So I try and, like get work done before, but I know that drinking gets in the way of productivity. So I try and minimize that as much as possible. You're trying to be responsible and get your stuff done. Yeah. Knowing that the drinking is gonna make it harder. Yeah. Okay. And it sounds like are you getting everything done or some stuff sort of slipping when you drink? Yeah, I guess when I drink some things do slip a little bit. But just because like when I'm drinking, I'm, I'm not really focused on what I have to do. I'm focused on the moment and just enjoying the time that I have at that time. And it's really something that I just it's something of an like a pleasure givers like and enjoying a joint enjoyment type of thing. What are the things you enjoy about the drinking? Just the way that it, it's sort of like liberates you and makes you it makes you feel like a more confident, more energetic person that you don't feel like yourself you feel like a different version of yourself. And it's something that you it, it's just empowering to a degree. Okay. So you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways? Yeah? Okay, are there any not so good things about drinking. Um, whenever I drink too much, I sort of lose control of myself and I I just like the aftermath of whenever I drank too much or whenever my friends mixed drinks and it just has a harmful effect on my body. That's probably one of the major drawbacks that I had from drinking. What kinds of things happen? I mainly when when I puke or it's just the the feeling that I get in my stomach, if I drink too much is just very overwhelming. Like you notice in your body, how much do you think is the most you've ever drank in one time? Wow, I would say probably at a friend, one of my friends had a birthday party recently. And he wanted to let loose was it was just the all the guys were together and they had a couple of friends over and it just turned into one big party and I just I lost it. I drank way too much I would say like probably a bottle or two and just some beers along the way. I got to a point where I lost count that was out of the ordinary For you to discount, what's a more typical amount that you drink? I don't let myself drink more than three or four beers on a given night. Just because I know I'm, I've gotten to the point where I sort of know my limit. But I kind of flirt with my limit just to see how far I can go. And I think that that sort of is very dangerous to play with fire, but I want to see how far I can go. Just so I know not to go that far. Got it. So you're you're sort of testing and pushing it in. Yeah. And sometimes crossing that limit and having some of the consequences that you mentioned. Yeah, just so I know how it feels now so that later on when this The situation is more drastic and more out of control. I know what I can do and where am I limit is it you? Well, kind of along those lines Looking ahead, you know, five years from now, what do you see as a goal for yourself in terms of career wise, in terms of what do you think you'll be doing in five years, and I would love to be. I would love to travel, I would love to see the world for what it is. And I've always seen pictures and videos of how the world is, but I've never really experienced that, like, I've always wanted to travel to Europe or, or China or something or someplace like that. So I can really experience the world that we live in. So getting a full experience is really important, too. It sounds like throughout your life, you know, you talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience. And now you're looking at how you can enrich your life in other ways. How do you think drinking too much would fit into, you know, being able to experience life to its fullest? I guess it could interfere with allowing myself to feel the effects of living life to the fullest. But I wouldn't want to tamper with drinking too much. Like, often, just because I'm I know, I've seen the consequences that drinking has on people and I know that I would never want to get to a degree where I need to drink constantly, every single day. I don't want to ever get to that point.  Okay. So just to kind of summarize what you've told me so far, you're you're drinking pretty regularly, but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drinks maybe is probably the maximum that you can drink before you're having some of these negative consequences. And you feel better if you limit yourself to three or less, yeah, feel more in control and then kind of looking ahead. You don't want to Find yourself being someone who's drinking all the time or someone who feels out of control with their drinking that you've seen that maybe in other people's lives, and it's not appealing to at all. And and you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve, that drinking too much could also interfere with. So where do you think you want to go from here with with regard to your drinking? Maybe now that I know, my limits to an extent, I kind of don't want to push it. So, so much. Now that I know what I can do and where I can go. I would like to mitigate that as much as possible. I just want to I want to have fun being me. But I don't want me to be influenced by alcohol. So much. Like I want to live the sober life to an extent, but I know that alcohol is just gonna tamper with it. So for right now It feels like a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking and make sure you're, you're stopping three, for example, or maybe even limiting the number of times that you're drinking. Yeah. And like not, like not drinking, like in the mornings or just just strictly for social purposes like not just to not have it around, like, I don't want to have it like in my fridge, if my parents have it. I don't want to I don't want to have to deal with it.  Okay. What do you see as some benefits to that? benefits and sticking to those limits? I guess I could definitely be, I could live a more fulfilled life to an extent like I could possibly be more productive, more efficient in my work and where I can possibly be in the next few years of my life. And I think that by not drinking, I will definitely have a better effect on my life. Yeah, I think taking steps to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea. And I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest question. You know, if you don't mind, I would like to talk to probably about this in a couple weeks or a couple months and just kind of check in how things are going. Right. All right. Sounds good.  Thank you very much.","The patient drinks beers whenever they are at parties. They drink every other weekend whenever there is a basketball or football game. The patient does not drink when they have productive work to do, and let loose completely on days they drink. But not so good things is the patient has become sick by mixing drinks and also by losing control and overdrinking. The patient three to four beers are acceptable on a given night. The patient feels crossing the limit is drastic and more out of control. The patient's life goal is to travel to the fullest. The patient agrees to limit drinking to three beers, and restrict only to social purposes. The patient wishes to be more productive and efficient at work in next few years of their life. They understand not drinking will have better effects. The therapist schedules another session in couple weeks or couple months. "
58,"Summarize: So we're here today to talk about CBT and your experiences of it. How did you feel initially about the thought of going for CBT my clinical psychologist has told me that I needed to see someone. I thought I didn't need to see someone because there was nothing wrong with me. I just had a heart disease. And I, my heart disease had got so severe and I was just tired and there was no one that could make it better. By listening to me or talking to me, the only thing I thought that could heal me was heart surgery. And when he suggested that I see someone, it didn't seem to make sense. But because I was so depressed, so far gone, I, my husband through my husband, I thought I try and just take a chance and just listen to someone or let someone Listen to me, because I wasn't sure what it entailed. I've never been to a clinical psychologist before. So to me as a clinical psychologist was a shrink, you must have had something seriously wrong with your brain that you needed to see a clinical psychologist, and I didn't need to see one. But when I did Mita and I realized that not being able to make up my mind by Waiting for surgery for heart surgery. I'm putting my name down on the list. I needed someone to help be accepted in order to get surgery done, because I didn't want to get surgery done and she listened to me and to the way I felt and what was making me whoa, hold back on surgery and what made me feel the way I did. And funnily enough, as a woman, you tend to feel that you can cry on someone else's shoulder. But for the first time, just letting my emotions out to her. She helped me cry and by me speaking to her, it helped me see myself from the inside. If that makes sense. I then I began to understand why I had to get heart surgery done wasn't because I was tired but I had my family and everyone that went through the road with me of suffering was mad so I needed to get it done. And then eventually I did put my name down on the list not knowing it would be done so quick because asked was just supposed to take me six to eight months to get heart surgery done. But when I started seeing my clinical psychology, I understood it, I put my name down and I got my surgery done in 30 days time. So it sounds like part of the clinical psychologists role with you is to help you to make your decision around whether to get surgery or not. Yes. But you also said that you were quite depressed at the time was the CBT helpful for your depression as well, it helped because then, instead of crying and holding things back emotionally, it helped me let things out. And by letting things out, it helped me understand what I was feeling because most of the time we bottle things up, we never let them out or we never talk to each other, or other people. So when we bottle stuff up, it makes it harder for us to figure out ways to solve problems. Sometimes it can be a little problem and we turn it into a big problem because we just don't communicate with other people or talk things over to make it easier to understand. And she helped me understand and I saw her before surgery right through my heart surgery and after heart surgery, and she helped me. By then by the time I started with heart surgery, I'd lost myself confidence. I was so depressed, I was so withdrawn. But after I had heart surgery, and I carried on seeing her, she helped me gain my confidence back again. She helped me gain my trust again, she helped me see that there was something worth loving for again. And a lot of times when I think of the things that are needed for me, it brings tears to my eyes and makes my heart swell up because I didn't know another person could do that for you. By just listening to you, you know, like when we go to mom when you got a problem and you think no one can understand, but my mom can because she knows what I'm coming from. But it's not to say that clinical psychologists are like that. But it's just the way they listen to you. Just having that someone that can listen to you and just be there and be still be quiet and let you express yourself. That's how and help you find out what problems are that you've got and help you solve those problems if they can. Was there anything about the CBT, in particular, that you found was helpful for you? Dr. Penny was there with me every step of the way. With all the problems that I had, she helped me Show me that there's an easier way to solve everything and not make a big problem out of everything. There's always someone every step of the way that stayed to help if you need a helping hand. And that's how I in by the time I'd finished therapy with her, I found out that clinical psychologists are not just strings. They are people like us and they do feel like us and it's so much easier. To speak to someone when you're having problems because we all do in our lifetime breakdown sooner or later. If you don't have to be mentally ill, you can be in a car accident, any any problems in the home is something you can even have a death in the family that you can break down with. And you need somebody just to hear you how you feeling, because we all assume that somebody else naturally knows what I'm feeling or thinking. But it's not that way. We all have different whether any drawbacks to going for CBT in the beginning, I didn't. I didn't have any drawbacks going for CBT because I was so severely depressed, I needed it. And I found that they were people all around that would help me so there was nothing. The only thing that was stopping me was me. Sounds like it was a good experience for us. If you go Any advice that you would want to offer anyone who is thinking now about going for CBT? Yes. Don't look at the word CBT. But look at the person behind it. Because sometimes we see big words and we don't understand the meaning of those words. And we assume, but sometimes when we look behind the word, like clinical psychologists, I would have said a shrink and I would never have thought myself going to one because they deal with mental people. But it's not that it's, you can have suffered from depression. You can suffer from any kind of illness and it's so good to go to a clinical psychologist when you need them. Because one, sooner or later in our lives, we will need one and most people when you know like when you find younger people that nowadays, lots of young people are going under so much stress in life. If you haven't got a parent or a friend, and you're suffering from depression, those are the right people to speak to because It's good to be able to have someone in your life that you can talk to. Because I know there's no one in my family that I can talk to. I always think my husband would never understand me. My kids would never understand me. When I go to the doctor, he never has that enough time for me. But with a clinical psychologist, they make that time for you. And they listen to you, you've got you've got that time with them to express yourself and you still got follow ups, they can check on you and make sure everything's right. If you not, everything's not alright. They can always check and find ways and means to help you. get you in touch with other people that can help you or get in touch with other people that are in the same. Having the suffering from the same conditions as you and you can swap ideas with each other to find and live a happier life.","The patient share their experience with CBT. The patient was suffering from a heart disease and believed getting a heart surgery was the only way to heal themselves. The patient was feeling depressed. The patient visited a clinical psychologist and felt better also by letting emotions out to the psychologist which was bottled up all the while. After surgery too, the psychologist helped the patient to regain confidence back. The patient was assisted by Dr. Penny helping them to find easier way to solve things. The patient did not find their family members nor their doctor empathizing with them. On the other hand, clinical psychologists help us express and have follow up sessions. The patient says they also help to get in touch with the right people who had same sufferings as you and can swap ideas to find and live happier life. "
59,"Summarize: Alright, so let's see if we could let's rank those two things. Right so one is everyone's judging me how I was and the other is a poor grade. Which one is larger fear for you? I would say maybe like judging. Okay, so the grades a concern. Yeah but I figured I could do better on the subsequent one but when people are have this opinion of you I feel like that doesn't go away as quickly What would it mean? If they they thought you were anxious during that presentation? I guess I worried that they would think I'm anxious because I don't know what I'm doing or I don't belong there.  So if they notice your anxiety, then they think you don't belong in that level Yeah. Like, I don't deserve to be in that program. If they don't recognize those symptoms, they wouldn't think that, do they? they might write that maybe they think that's why I'm anxious or that's why I'm not doing well. Well, how do you feel about your abilities and status in the programming room? I think you know, typically, I'm one of the top students in my program, and I've seen two Get the concepts pretty well. It's just when I have to demonstrate those concepts or demonstrate via, like a presentation or something, that I'm worried that, you know, maybe I'm an imposter or something, but so I start to question myself. But I think in general that, you know, I'm a pretty good student before this. And I'm doing pretty well in the program. So you're a good student, you recognize that you have this one area where you don't feel like you do a great job. That's presentations. In terms of grade, you really only had one bad presentation. But grades aside, you're anxious. And you're worried your classmates are gonna pick up on them. Yeah, exactly. Okay. So if they thought you were us were imposter. So if they thought you were imposter to say that that was something they actually believe because of what's been happening. What would that mean? What would it mean to your classmates that you were an imposter? I don't know. Maybe I am. Maybe I don't deserve to be there. You don't deserve to be there. like maybe I shouldn't be in this program. I think they should just drop out. So if they believe you're an imposter based on these physical symptoms, like anxiety and mood that means to you anyway, that that means you shouldn't be on there. Yeah. What's it feel like to say that Depressing I feel like I've worked really hard. You know, to get through atleast halfway through my program. And it really hurts to think that that will be true. Just think this whole time you really been given faking Do you really belong there?. So I'd like to move a little bit into evaluating evidence. So in this kind of therapy, we like to look at what, you know, what we're feeling and what we're thinking, and what's we can see what's observable around us. And, you know, that becomes evidence and then we analyze it, evaluate it, okay. You're worried at some level. You're worried that you don't deserve to be where you are right now. Yeah. That you're not good enough. To be a student in this program, yeah, programming. What evidence supports that belief that you're not good enough? Now that I'm thinking about it here, I mean, there's not a ton to support. But in on that day, I can think of all sorts of, you know, things to tell myself what's going on that day. So maybe like I'm not prepared or because I'm messing up on the presentation that I'm going to get a bad grade and you know, if I can't speak in front of people, how am I going to speak in front of kids as a teacher, you know, one day that it will translate to something else. I can't get past this. So even if you survived the program, somehow you might be bad at your job yeah any other evidence that points toward you being imposter? Besides My bad grade? Not a whole lot. Right. So to be safe to say that a lot of that thought of I'm not good enough is kind of based on your feelings of anxiety. Yeah. Which are really intense like panic almost in the moment. Yeah so in a way you're believing With the anxiety will lead you to believe. Yeah, definitely.  But in the bright light of scrutiny, there are a lot of facts to support the worst case, which is you don't deserve it. How about evidence that refutes that you're not good enough? I would say that, you know, I was accepted into the program. Like there's kind of like, a pretty rigorous sort of testing and stuff, which I passed, to get interviews and such to get into the program. So I did that. Like I said, I'm a pretty good student, all considering, you know, before this kind of flick was happening. Okay, so you've got through a rigorous process to become a student You're doing well. You mentioned before, just the one bad grade right? Okay, so if you have friends in this program, right, if one of them came to you with this, this balance of, you know, one bad grade and some anxiety, yeah, versus passing, you know, rigorous standards and doing well, otherwise, what advice would you give them? I mean, now that you're kind of like talking about it, like, you know, this or that sort of thing. It makes sense. I would probably say that, well, you seem to be doing pretty well so far. You know, that anyone evaluating would look at all of the cumulative how you're doing your performance, rather than that one grade would you feel comfortable giving advice to yourself? I think I tried to sometimes, but my anxiety symptoms kind of like really, like you were saying, your anxiety tells you sort of I think I can think that but I think my anxiety symptoms are such in the moment that it's really hard. You know, and I'm replaying what happened before in my head anticipation predicting will happen again. So, so let's look at the the thought and the feeling. If you had to rate the percent that you believed this thought, this belief that you are not good enough to be in the program, like right now right now, yeah, but here with me. How much of your mind believes that that's true? I would say like, you know, a two or three like not very, I don't believe it very much right now because You know, I'm not presenting and it's just you and I not like a group full of people. So that pressure is not there here. So right now you're really not buying the idea that you're not good enough. Yeah, that is correct  So now let's move to let's say right in the near the end of presentation when that anxiety is there, and the classmates that could be looking at you, it could be negatively evaluating you because you're worried about how much do you believe that thought then? I don't feel really confident. In that moment. It feels very real. Like, like any moment, they're gonna kick me out. Like, I'm just not doing well. I'm stuffing. Yeah. really intense. So would you think that you were a more accurate evaluator of what's true or not. Now, or when you're in that state of anxiety, definitely now that anxiety that, you know, heart rate and sweating is not there. So this evaluation, the percent that you believe that true, this evaluation is more accurate? Yes, I think so. And how much time in any given day would you spend kind of in a mood right now, or you can evaluate accurately? I would say, you know, when I'm not at risk of presenting, like, I feel like I spend the majority of my time, like, it's not something I worry about all the time, just leading up to and then mostly that day, okay. So the, so you're able to evaluate the way you are now, the vast majority of the time, right? There's a limited amount of time when you're not when there's A lot of motions going through, right? And at those times, you're maybe a little less reliable, right. Like my judgment is clouded. However, in that moment you still, those thoughts are strong, right?  Yes, very troubling.  Even though it's a small percentage, it's intense. And you kind of carry that around a little bit. Yeah. Exactly. So I can see why this is frustrating for you.","The patient has a larger fear over everyone judging them. The patient believes other classmates recognise their symptoms of anxiety and may feel the patient does not deserve the program. The patient has had only one bad presentation in terms of grades. But on the day of presentation they think of reasons to mess up and are scared how they are going to speak in front of kids as a teacher in the future. The patient agrees a lot of their anxiety comes from their thought and not evidence. The patient agrees if they were to advice someone else in similar situation, they would assure the other person doing well and only the cumulative grades will be considered. The patient has an anxiety in anticipation that something will happen. The patient agrees their evaluation is clear at other days when they don't have presentation, however they point out that the emotions are intense during the presentation and their judgement is clouded. "
60,"Summarize: Okay, Charles, let's take a look at your homework from last week the activity schedule. Not very much on it. I'll take a look at it and see, well, you did complete most of it. I don't see the point. And I mean, how do you master watching TV or eating a meal? I, if I had tried to use chopsticks, I suppose it would have some mastery involved in but I, I didn't mess with chopsticks, okay. Food was okay. Hmm. But not, not great. Okay. So it was tough. And I just want to be clear, though, Charles that this is very typical though for many people that we work with. It's very difficult to complete homework worksheets, because things happen, right? I don't feel that Well, sometimes things get in the way. There's things that just prevent me from doing that. So I think our job together is to try to figure out what are the sort of barriers that make these sort of things difficult. So what would you say what would be some barriers that made it difficult to Your mastery ratings. I don't enjoy anything. And I used to I used to enjoy it a lot of things. But I don't even I don't look forward to breakfast, particularly cup of coffee. The news is mostly bad and what if there is news? I mean, the paper doesn't carry much national news anymore. So, I mean, I have to eat, but I really don't see the point of a lot of things. Okay. Okay. Well, I think something that will be useful for both of us, Charles is to collaboratively work together and figure out how we can look at the perceived benefit of doing some of these things. versus the cons. So there's a worksheet that I have called a decisional balance worksheet. And it basically takes two separate decisions. One decision is to engage in activities, and there's some benefit to doing that. And then another decision would be to not engage in activities. There's benefit to that. But there's also cost to both of those decisions. So I think one objective way for you to look at this worksheet would be to determine what are the sort of things you could do and determine whether there's more benefit or cost to completing that? What do you think about that? Well, that would depend on the activity. I know but okay. I could, I could get in touch with somebody I could call a friend. Maybe try to meet somebody for lunch. Okay, that's a great idea. So what would be a benefit of calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch? Well, I would, I would enjoy the company. Okay, and wouldn't be as lonely I suppose. Okay, that sounds great. So sounds like one benefit would be you'd enjoy the company. Yeah. And you wouldn't be as lonely. So I'd write that down. Okay, good. Company company and said not as lonely not only. That's good, okay. Okay, can you think of the downside to potentially doing that? Well, one downside might be that he wouldn't be interested in having lunch with me. I haven't been a whole lot of fun lately. And, or he might be busy and might not not might not be able to have lunch. Okay, or he might want to talk about what's going on in my life and I'm ready We don't want to talk about that let somebody talk about it with you course. Okay. So it sounds like the most practical one of those would be that he may be busy. Right? That could be the downside. Is that right? Okay. might not be able to come. Sure. Okay. So I'd write that is a great job Charles with the top two boxes with the first decision. So let's move to the second decision, which would be to stay the same and there's some benefit to that and there's some cost to that as well. Sure. Okay, Charles, so we completed the worksheet. So what's your overall impression about the benefits of changing versus the cons and staying the same? Well, it makes sure that the, the benefits outweigh the cons. If, if I make the change if I don't make the change I'll be doing just what I've been doing and I'll be getting up wondering, what's the point? And well still be lonely. And Those are good observations, Charles. So, which activity doesn't make the most sense to try for homework this week? Well, I call somebody I think, Okay. Okay, that's a good observation. So, let's say for homework, then you tried to call someone to get together with a friend. And how about also trying to complete a full day of the activity schedule, and completing both the mastery and the pleasure ratings? What do you think about that? Sure. Okay. Okay. And if it gets Difficult, which again, that's pretty normal for that to take place. If it gets hard, we can talk about it next time and we can problem solve together and figure out how to remove those barriers. Does that sound good? Sure. Okay, okay.",The therapist discusses patient's last week homework schedule. The patient is disinterested to carry out the activities. The therapist explains that it is a decisional balance worksheet and request to weigh pros and cons for each activity. The patient feels calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch sounds exciting and wouldn't be as lonely. The therapist highlights the practical downsides to that maybe the person is busy and not able to come from the responses from patient. The patient agrees the cons of staying the same will not change anything and they will feel lonely. The therapist encourages to meet someone as a homework and asks to try out a full day activity schedule. The therapist aknowledges it will be hard and the problems can be addressed in next session.
61,"Summarize: Do you have on your presentation? Do you have so many? Like bullet points you want to cover? Like, yeah, okay, like an outline sort of thing. Okay. Would it help to time the deep breathing with reviewing each one of those bullet points? We never thought about that. I don't know how many bullet points you'd have in a presentation. Maybe you'd have 10 or 20. Yeah, depending on how long right so maybe you as you start to review a certain bullet point As you're trying to get it into your memory and think about it, you breathe in really deeply. And then as you continue on, you just let out that breath really slowly, like a rhythm sort of, huh? Yeah. Can you go and do the same thing?  I thought about it that way. I'm just thinking it'd be some way to structure. So you would, you would get in so many breaths, something I wouldn't forget. Yeah. Yeah, something that kind of becomes a habit. Okay. Just make sure you keep your bullet points of length. About a few paragraphs. Yeah. But just just a few seconds each. So you can get a good deep breath and, or you could, you know, if you did have a longer bullet point, you could have obviously, several breaths, but just some rhythm that you could kind of grab on to something concrete. Yeah. Because I know that. In that moment, things are probably like you mentioned zoning out and right It becomes very easy to lose your anchors. Yeah, exactly. And just get really foggy, almost dizzy. Yeah, so if you can remember, you know, for a particular bullet point that you want to take three deep breaths. And that might be something you can really have one too. Yeah. And would we kind of cut through that fogginess something could still do. Okay. When's the next presentation in that class that's coming up? The next one, I believe is next Friday. Is that the next presentation you have? Like in all the classes is the one Yeah. . Okay. And that's next Friday. Mm hmm. Do you know where you are in the order? Like for presenting? Um, I think I'm actually third in this one. not first. And this one's how many minutes I'm like 15 or so. Okay, it's a little shorter than 20 minutes. So you have about a half hour, maybe a little more, if there's time to switch out of kind of sitting there, right. And potential time where you could be anxious. Yes, but also potential time and you could be reviewing the notes your bullet points and breathing. Yeah. And saying to yourself, that's so like, kind of self talk, that they're not really paying attention to me anyway. Right. Right. Because that might help reduce that. That anxiety. Yeah. What's one thing you could say to yourself when you're up there? I guess I could say that, you know, in general, I do pretty well. You know, one bad grade as in going to war. Make me doesn't mean that I don't deserve to be here. Okay, so the sort of self talk up there could be I deserve to be here. Maybe I've prepared enough, you know that I know that I've prepared. And I'm a good student. Okay. I've prepared enough. I'm a good student. I deserve to be here. Yeah. Is that something that would be helpful to write down and have as part of your notes that you can? Yeah, I think it would actually, I can recite that. Yeah, internally as you because it's not long.  I think I could, it will be easy to remember. And I could just like maybe put it down on one of my note cards in front of me or something. And how much do you believe that those statements are true? I think you know, sitting now, sitting here now I believe them in the moment sometimes it's a little hard to believe because I convinced myself otherwise. But I think I actually believe that that that that's true. They deserve to be in the program. Okay, so there's those self talk items. You believe them to be true. Yeah, but you recognize in the moment, and I want you to be aware of this. You might not believe them as much, right? But remember that, you know, we worked on them. Right? You came up with them. Yeah.  And you believe them now. Right? So try to keep that in your mind as you start to doubt yourself.  Yeah. It's easy. I realize it's easy to form these plans. Right. Then the chaos of anxiety in the words is harder. So the more tasks you can make concrete, and you can write down and you can rehearse, I think the better off you'll be. Okay. I would like to see you your presentations next Friday. Yeah, I would like to see you right before that. So be about a week. Okay for that. Do you have any questions? These are items you can rehearse still even without the presentation, the self talk and write the breathing, and of course preparing. But you have any questions between now and then you think? I don't think so I think it makes sense. Yeah. Understand kind of the plan to attack that anxiety symptom And I think you know, what you kind of suggested before, like, maybe practicing my deep breathing. Like maybe now, like when I'm calm and getting into a habit of deep breathing, like, I'm more apt to also remember it, then. Right. So, so good. So you have some kind of behavioral pieces. Focus on studying the breathing. And so cognitive pieces that the self talk we talked about, yeah. That you use when you're seated and use when you're at the podium, right And actually presenting. Alright, good. So I'm glad we have a plan going forward. I think that you did a really good job today, helping kind of untangle this and figure out what's going on. And I appreciate that. You were able to really connect with the symptoms and the thoughts and kind of realize how they're related. Yeah. And I feel like this is something that's going to serve you well as you move through this.  Thank you. All right. So I'll see you in, in a week.  Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Hazel.","The therapist is helping the patient with a presentation by using bullet points to cover.

The therapist also acknowledges that these may not be easy in the actual situation and asks the patient to practice this continously since this can be practiced without the presentation. The therapist asks to rehearse and meet them before the presentation, in a week. The therapist asserts to the patient that they are attacking the anxiety symptom. "
62,"Summarize: So Sam is healthy other than some seasonal allergies and everything else Okay, then. Actually, not quite. I don't know what's been happening but between last school year and this year, all of a sudden I'm getting these phone calls from his teacher saying that he's not paying attention in class. They think he has ADHD all of a sudden. I mean, I don't know where this is coming from. But this is not the same kid I had a year ago. Okay, so sounds like there's a little bit more going on that and some more worries that you wanted to talk about. So perhaps it makes sense that, that we take a few minutes and then I chat with you, and then I'll spend a few minutes with Sam. Sure. It'll be great. Okay, Sam, do you want to go in, hang out in the waiting room for bed and I'll come find you in a few minutes. Go ahead, honey. So tell me about Sam and the issues that he's having in school. Well, he's like a totally different kid and not in a good way. All of a sudden, this year, I've been getting calls three, four times a week from his teacher, the principal. They're saying things like he's acting out in class. He's having little kind of angry spurts. All of a sudden, he's not doing his homework, which is completely new to me. His grades are slipping. I mean, he used to be like, 70s 80s 90s kids. Now he's getting 60s. So this feels like a real diversion from last year real change from last year. Oh, totally like night and day. Okay, so it sounds like there's been some problems at home. So I'm going to ask you some screening questions that I asked all the parents, some of them might fit for you. And some of them may not probably take about five minutes, and we'll just go through them together. Sure, let's do it. So why don't we start with how you're doing? Um, honestly, I'm getting by. I mean, I think you know, Darrell and I got divorced last year. He's somewhere out in BC God only knows where. So is he seeing Sam at all, or? I think they Skype maybe once every couple months, but he's really not been in contact. And he's not been sending the money that he promised he would. So we're not thrilled with him right now. So has that meant that finances have been tight or? Yeah, I mean, I was kind of counting on the child support to come in. You know, things are tight with three people household and then For almost since long, Darren's been gone. My mother has also moved in with me. She, you know, as you get older, she's starting to get a little bit more dementia. Some people just stick their parents in a home but I was the good daughter and I decided to take her into mind. So lots of changes, lots of things going on. Yeah. And how do you feel like you're managing with all that? I mean, some days are obviously better or worse than others it's been a lot of changes like you said, I mean, I'm not getting enough sleep I'm things are tight financially. Emotionally, how have you been doing them and managing things are  you know sometimes very stressful, like if my mother has an episode or when I get called from school, but like, I don't think I'm really like depressed or anything, it just it's kind of day to day thing. So there are ever any times that you're not managing well, like you're not good at able to get out of bed or do the things that you need to do in a day. There's a couple mornings that I sleep in, but it's really like I still kind of get by I get everything done I need to like, I know it's kind of a tough time right now but I don't feel like it's gonna be hopeless forever. Hopefully. So some struggles but yeah, okay. Do you ever cope with using drugs or alcohol? No, I mean my mother used to drink but I tried to be really aware of not using that as a crutch. So then no drinking at all at home? no drinking and I definitely don't want drugs in the house for the kids. So none of either. What about making sure that Sam and your little one have what they need in terms of winter coats or food or or those sorts of things? I I'm doing the best I can you know, like, we haven't gotten a chance to get winter coat shopping yet. His from last year still kind of it It's not great but it's solution for now. So he's wearing his coat from last year. Yeah. Do you have a sense about is that hard because of finances are there other reasons mostly finances but I mean kind of time too like to get everybody out the door to go grocery shopping or go clothes shopping. It's a big ordeal. Right? I mean, I know. We didn't pick up everything he wanted her back to school this year either. It would be easier to add a few extra dollars in a few extra hours. Right. So Sam's not always having the things that he needs right now then. I guess not exactly. No. Yeah. And what about you know food or you deserve food in the fridge? Are you able to put food on the course I mean, we have the bulk foods were membership. So when we do get out I let Sam pick out things he likes to make, you know, macaroni stuff for sandwiches, cereals. That way, you know sometimes he makes himself breakfast in the morn. before school or dinners, And what kinds of things does Sam have for dinner? Like I said, like he'll do macaroni. You know, sometimes it's not great, but I'll do like the fruit or, you know, sometimes some snack food, sometimes more comprehensive meals, I guess. I was what would you say he does? Is he cooking? Or are you cooking or both? I guess kind of a mix of both. To be honest, like, So with all the stress in the house, has there been any times that people have kind of gotten really upset with Sam or yelled at them or said mean or hurtful things to him? Not really. I mean, And what about how his discipline handled in your house? Has anybody ever spanked or hit or physically hurt Sam in any way? No, never. I mean, I used to give him timeouts when he was younger, but What about sexual abuse? Has anyone touched Sam in a sexual way or an inappropriate way? Excuse me? Yeah, that's a hard question to hear for lots of people. But I asked everybody that question, so no, no, never. I I would never let that happen to my child. Okay. So, so he's been safe from sexual abuse or from sexual appropriate touch. Okay. So how do you think Sam's doing in his close family relationships do you think Sam's feeling loved And supported. I mean, I know I guess I haven't really been around for him as much as I'd like to be obviously, I do the best to let them know we know how much I care for him. Sometimes we have a little bit more money, I can get him something nice that he wants. You know, I've heard him kind of, he's kind of a thought that Oh, you love the baby more than you love me. But that's that's obviously not true. I love both my kids. So what do you think he would say if he was here? And I asked him if he felt loved. I'd hope he'd say yes. There's some doubt?  I mean, like I said, like I'm You mentioned that there was some some some difficulties with your mom. Well, she's lived with us for the past year or so. She was diagnosed with dementia so she has days where she remembers Everything and days where she started to slip more and more. And she just she's very judgmental very opinionated. She has the way she likes things. And has there been any time that your mom has become physically aggressive in the home? No, never. And what about her relationship with you? How is she managing or how are you managing together with her in the home? Some days are definitely better than others. She like, I guess you could say I kind of tried to check her behavior when she was getting a little bit And Has it ever come to physical blows between the two of you? No, no just arguments here and there. And when you mean arguments how intense are those arguments getting? Like we raise our voices I mean, it's I'm doing the best I can here Is it ever it's never come to physical blows? No, never. I'd have to take some other action if that happened. And that, that that intensity, is that kind of like arguing or is it like yelling, screaming and door slamming or people throwing objects? I guess you could say we've gotten pretty loud. I mean, she'll go and kind of slam things in her room. You know, I'm, I obviously I wouldn't ever let her hurt the kids. And where are Sam and the baby when these things are happening? Sam will usually go and hide in this room, maybe turn this music up. You know, Lee's sometimes napping in the crib in the playpen, I guess to be totally honest, I do lose my patience and scream more than I'd like to but so it sounds like there's kind of a lot of tension and, and, and arguing in that relationship. How often would you say that that's happening that it comes to that kind of arguing and yelling place? I guess like a few times a week. Can one sort of last question what has anyone in your family been in prison or in jail? No, never.  Okay. So thank you very much for sharing all of that. I'm just going to recap. Sounds like there's been a lot of stressors and lots of change over the last year. Yeah. Sam status moved away, which is kind of created some changes in finances, which have led to, maybe not always having the food or the clothing that you've needed or that Sam has needed. You've got, your mom has moved in, and there's some stress and tension and arguing that's happening in that. And you've also told me that maybe all of these stressors and stuff have contributed to Sam not feeling as loved or as cared for. On the other hand, it sounds like you're managing emotionally and that you're not using any drugs or alcohol. You have told me that there are no concerns regarding physical, emotional or sexual abuse. For Sam and his life, and that nobody in your family more in Sam's life has gone to prison. So I think you're right there is likely a connection between kind of what's happening for Sam in school and the difficulties that he's starting to have with all of these stresses and changes at home. So I'm going to book a follow up appointment for you and Sam to come in. And at that time, we'll talk about some of the ways in which I might be able to help or develop a plan together. Sounds Sounds good. Thank you. Okay. All right. So make sure you make an appointment on your way out to come back in as soon as you can. Okay. And you said you wanted to see Sam for a bit as well. Yeah. You gotta see Sam right now. And then when when I'm done, just make sure on the way that you talk to reception about making another appointment. Okay. All right. Exactly. Last All right. Okay. Thanks. ","The patient has received calls from their kid's school that their son is not paying attention in class and might be suffering from ADHD.

63,"Summarize: Jessica, what's that? doing? Okay. I understand you've been having some recent difficulties that brought you into our agency. Can you tell me about that? Well, I've been having a lot of anxiety lately. Anxiety? just getting really nervous in the morning when it's time to go to work. Just like butterflies in my stomach kinda pounding heart. So, so you're anxious when you're getting ready to go to work. Do you know what might be causing that? Well I noticed it a little while ago when I went to get in my car to go to work Monday morning, I was putting some stuff in the trunk and I saw some some damage that had happened to the corner from a previous car accident and just out of nowhere I started feeling nervous about driving to work. Right. So you, you went out to Cory so some damage reminded you of an accident. Yeah, I was I was in an accident at the end of last year, and, you know, I didn't get hurt. There was no real damage to the car that I that I noticed. I just went on about my business I you know, didn't have any issues after the accident. And now all of a sudden, I'm Thinking about this car accident again. And I don't know where it's coming from. They said the exit occurred at the end of last year. Yeah, um So maybe about eight months ago. That's right. Yeah, probably around Halloween or so.  And when did the symptoms start being anxious when you're getting ready to go to work? I would say at least a month ago, maybe six weeks. And you've been having those continuously from then. Every morning I get up I'm just really nervous about going to work and you know, have come out to get in the car and sometimes I can barely get in just thinking about been in a car accident again. Ever been late to work because of the anxiety? I'm late almost every day almost every day. So this has been this has been a problem for you in a few different ways. Yeah, I even called out a couple times because I was just paralyzed. Have you tried a thing to reduce things IE like using another car or anything else? Well yeah, I live in a house with multiple cars. So I tried driving my mom's car one day and you know, I have the same feelings. And initially I thought it was just my car because I did notice some damage to the back of the car. I was in the bag and I was going through the trunk one day and I saw that the the core was actually pushed in. I didn't think there was any real damage and I noticed damage to the back of the car. And I was like, wow, you know, I have been seriously hurt in this accident. And that's when I started having these feelings like I just started thinking about how bad the accident could have been. So, you asked if I tried to do anything different. I tried driving my mom's car. I tried driving my dad's car, but it seems to be just driving any car, having all this anxiety. Right, and you're having physical distress, too? Yeah. Like you're feeling. You're feeling physical while I do a lot of like, swelling in my chest, like really panicky. Or you're having dreams about the accident or anything related to the accident? No, not really. Do you ever have a point when you're not asleep? Where you feel like you're kind of taken back to the time of the accident happened like a reliving it anyway?  No nothing like that.  Do you remember the accident? Oh, yeah, I remember it pretty well. I was waiting at a stop sign and I think the person behind me they must not have been paying attention but they rear ended me Who do you believe is responsible for the accident? Nobody really. I mean, it was it was an accident. There was no real damage. You know, accidents happen all the time, just a fender bender. So from the time that you notice these anxiety symptoms, have you had periods where you were happy and positive emotional experiences. I've been really down since I've been since I started having these The whole time you've been down or the moments where you haven't been there's been consistently down I would say more down or down but but sometimes up I can't really remember any not sure. How about your relationships with other people they changed from when was the anxiety started? No, not really.  You feel detached from people? not detach to be like separated. Yeah. not want to be about not connecting with people?   No, not really like that. Do you have any feelings of irritability or anger outbursts or anything like that? Nothing. You feel like you've been behaving more reckless way? What do you mean by reckless? That you take more chances in relationships or another nothing like that you're aware of like when something surprises us, we kind of have the startle response. Jump. It's natural. Have you noticed that? responses changed? Oh yeah have been a little a little on edge things have been like scaring me the phone ring in people knocking at the door dogs barking is kind of hit me on edge a little bit. And you feel like the responses more than it used to be more just the natural star response. Yeah, yeah, that's kind of worries me a little bit that's running.  A trouble concentrating.? No  Okay, Australia. staying focused has been good in that area. How about troubled sleep? trouble falling asleep staying asleep? No trouble falling asleep, but I have had trouble staying asleep. I've been waking up pretty much around the clock throughout the night. So you're getting to sleep Okay, falling asleep. Okay, but just having trouble staying asleep. Are you thinking of anything specific when you wake up? Not really just maybe like thinking about going to work in the morning. But no, nothing, nothing major. any use of drugs or alcohol? No. How about medical problems? no  Are there ever points from an anxiety started, that you feel kind of outside of your own body Come an unreal feeling where you're separated from your body? No. How about times when you feel disconnected from the environment, like an unreal feeling about what's going on around you?  No, nothing like that.  Jessica, I'm going to get you in to see a counselor here. If you're open to that, that's something you want to do. Yes. And I appreciate you taking the time to tell me what's going on and answer these questions. It's been helpful.  Thank you for seeing me. Sure.","The patient has been experiencing a lot of anxiety.

64,"Summarize: Hello, Peggy, how you doing today? I'm okay, you're okay. Glad to hear that. Yesterday, when you're here at the agency, you took a few different tests. Remember that? I did. One of the tests you took is called the SCL 90, the symptom checklist 90. Do you remember taking that test? I think so. It's 90 items. And they are ranked asked me like true and false questions? Not true and false are numbers that you solve.  Oh, okay. I do remember that. Okay. So I have the results from that test. I want to review some of those findings with you.  Okay. All right. Sure. So this particular instrument has a number of what we refer to as sub scales. So these are areas that are measured by the instrument, right? For example, depression or anxiety. So I'm going to review a few of these sub scales, ones where you scored a little higher than we might expect. And just review those with you and see. See what you're thinking we can talk about.  Okay, are you recording this?  No Are very worried about that? Is it what makes you think I'm recording? Because that happens to me a lot. It happens to you a lot that you get recorded.  I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Remember the last time it happened? You probably yesterday And you think you were recorded while you're taking this? probably. Yeah. That sounds worrisome. That's that's a feeling you get a lot that you're being recorded. I worry about it a lot. You worry about it a lot. But you know, it's happening. That's why I worry about it. You're certain that's happening? Yeah. Where you're not being recorded now. I know. It probably feels like you are, but you're not. Okay.  Okay. But I appreciate you bringing up that concern with me.  I think so in school,  in school, right? I that would make sense. So, say for instance, you had a percentile rank of 65% Right percentile, that would mean that your score is equal to or higher than 65% of people that took that test. Okay, so that makes sense. So if you took a test on math or English, and you would say 75 percentile, you'd be higher than three quarters of people took the test. 75% Okay, understand? Does that make sense? I think so. Okay. If you want me to come back to that later, just let me know as I go through if it doesn't make sense, okay. So areas here on on the SCL results, or you were a bit higher than we would normally see. A one is the phobic anxiety scale. on that one, you were about 64 percentile. So your score was as high or higher. Than 64% of people who take it  to more than half the people in the population, more than half the number and half the people in the same situation as you in outpatient mental health treatment. So I have more phobic anxiety than most people. It does seem that way. Yeah. So this construct would measure things like being afraid of going out being afraid of being a crowds. Does that connect with you? Is that seem like a fear that you have? Yeah. Okay. Tell me about that. I don't like being on public transportation. Hmm. And crowds make me nervous. If I ever have to public speak, I feel like I'm just going to pass out. So it does appear you have kind of phobic anxiety symptoms. So that that score today that 64 percentile. That kind of makes sense. I kind of get that I want to move on to the next one, which is paranoia. On this one, you were at the 84th. percentile. So quite a bit higher. Is that why you were recording me? But this, this wasn't recorded, nothing was recorded here. Understand that's a worry that you have. Are you going to share those results with anybody? in your particular case, the only people will be shared with this the rest of the treatment team and anybody that you sign a release for, but if the government asks you, you'd have to give them those results. There's no reason right now I did that there are certain limits to confidentiality. But in your situation here at this clinic, there's no reason I would share this information with the government or, or anybody else other than people indicated. So the rest of the people here to treat you. And if you wanted to release the results to somebody, you could sign a release I would let them have the results. Well, I'm worried that I know people are recording me. And I think that that results shows that I know that's happening. And now, you want to make it look like that means I have a problem. When I'm just reporting what I know is true. Well, I assume you're worried that no, I think that I know these things are happening. But this test says that I'm wrong to think that it makes me paranoid. Oh, I understand. Okay. So these things are really happening. Yeah. Right. But the test is arranged so that it's making it look paranoid when you're not exactly Exactly. Okay. So that would explain why your score is elevated on the scale. Okay. Is that? Is that what you're thinking?  I do. Yeah. And I wanted you to know that. I appreciate you telling me that. Do you think it's possible that it's working the other way around that the test is measuring something that is actually there? No, I don't think so. You don't think so. Okay. I understand that. I'm higher than most people. you believe their situation is different than yours. Okay, I understand. So the last area, the last subscale I want to discuss this one global scale on discuss. Glass subscale is one that's referred to as psychoticism. And there you are at the 93rd percentile. And that's when maybe you can hear things other people hear or see things that people don't see, or have beliefs or thinking that are far outside the norm and can't be supported by evidence. They feel like that's happening to you. Are you going to put me away? There's There's nothing here that would indicate that I'm gonna put you away or center anywhere. Yeah, I just really this The purpose of this is just to discuss the results to make sure you understand kind of how these inform our treatment of you. Like so we're gonna provide treatment to impart based on these results. Sometimes I hear things other people don't hear. Okay, so this is a this is a score that makes makes sense to retake the test might be right. Maybe that's true. Maybe that's true. Okay, but I am being recorded, but you believe you're being recorded, you're starting to that. close to normal. Well, a little bit higher than we want to see. Me I don't like to go out much. So at the Paranoid if that if that scale was accurate, in your estimation, your global severity might be lower, I think, yeah. Closer to the 50 percentile, I think. So, even if you were closer to the 50 percentile, you can To understand how we're concerned that your symptoms are somewhat severe, and we want to make sure we deliver treatment to address that. Sure. Is that okay? It is. Okay. So I will meet with the counselor that will be treating, you're here, and I'm going to go over these scores now explain to her what you've explained to me. Okay, in terms of why you think you might have received the score. Okay, I'll go over that with her. And of course, you could discuss it with her too, and she'll have the results of this test in your chart.  Okay. Okay. She's not going to record our session. She, she's not going to be recording. Okay. It does. Okay. I appreciate you allow me to go over this set of results with you. And I'm going to show you assigned to that counselor and we'll move forward with treatment. Okay. Thank thanks, Peggy.","The therapist is reviewing the findings of SCL 90 test where the sub scales are little higher than expected. The patient is worried if the session is recorded and is assured by the therapist that it is not. The therapist highlights the patient scored 64 percentile on phobic anxiety symptoms. The patient agrees they don't like public transportations, crowds make them nervous, and they can't speak publicly. Next, the therapist says the patient has scored 84 percentile on paranoia. The patient argues that they know they are being recorded which is a fact and stating that makes the test to be true about paranoia about them which is not exactly. The patient still agrees they can be higher than most people for paranoia but not that high. The patient asks if these results be shared with the government for which the therapist clarifies it will only be shared with the treatment team. The last thing therapist highlights from the test is psychoticism in whcih they scored 93 percentile. The patient agrees that they do hear things that other's don't. The patient continues to express discomfort that they are being recorded. The therapist assured to setup the patient with a counselor and share the results with them. "
65,"Summarize: So Charles, it sounds like things have been going pretty well recently, but they've been going better. Yeah, they have good I did call a friend. And we had lunch. I'd seen this guy in two or three years and it was good to see him when we contacted again and agreed we maybe have lunch. From time to time, that'd be good. And I got back in the kitchen, I made this pretty good soup. It's an asparagus potato soup that sounds very it's it's really good to chop up the asparagus and the potatoes and one small onion and boil them and then use a blender to give it a real nice texture, texture a little bit like split pea soup, sounds good without a split pea and so on. feeling some better.  That's good. That's good. Charles, I'm proud of you for taking the initiative. Because I know it's been difficult in the past and you've really championed the things we've talked about, and I'm really proud of you for that. One thing you didn't mention was the woodworking shop that we've talked about in the past is that has that been? Well, that's still a mess. Okay, in fact, it's a it's a it's it's a big mess. It's such a mess that I really can't get in there and do any work. I haven't done that for some time. Okay. Every surface every why we got to work benches and Kinda Okay, well as we've talked about in the past, it's really difficult to get started on some things that we've avoided for quite some time. So, like in the past, let's brainstorm. Try to figure out how we can get some some movement in the woodworking shops. That sound good. Sure. Okay, so so one thing we've discussed in the past, Charles is extremely important is what you're thinking about as you're going into the woodworking shop. So, what are your thoughts? When you are viewing or looking at the woodworking shop? What do you think? Well, when I stand there in it, and I feel helpless, I mean it. It's hopeless, it seems to me that okay, just get it back in shape again. Okay, so let's explore that. So. So what's the evidence that it's hopeless to do some work in the woodworking shop? Well, just the mess that it is. I mean, that how disorganized and Okay, so it sounds like you're saying then it's disorganized. And it's a mess.  So how do you feel when you think about the woodworking shop that way? hopeless, okay, I think just Okay. So it prevents you from actually getting things done is what you're saying? Yes. Okay. Which makes sense because if I thought about it that way to Charles, it would be hard for me to initiate any kind of action because if I view it as overwhelming, then I'm probably They're not gonna do anything, which makes sense. So, so what do you think is an alternative way to view the woodworking shop? That would actually be helpful? What's another way? Well, if I could get one workbench cleaned off, okay, I would have some space to work on. Okay, that's a really good start. Well, I could make some things that I've been thinking about making for some time. Okay, I kind of have the plans in my head. Okay. I've thought about a medieval, kind of small medieval catapult for my grandson. And maybe Boomerang made out of really nice laminated wood, that would be cool. And so I could get one or both of those built, perhaps. Okay? And what would that lead to? If you get those things built? What would you have to do anything with those things? Well, if I if I built those, I would have to get in the car and drive for hours today. Okay, my grandkids where my grandkids are and to give them the, the toys, okay, and show them how it works and have shown how to throw the boomerang. So it sounds like there's a lot of benefit then to clearing out a bench and moving tools which would lead to you getting things done, especially things that would involve your grandkids so you'd be able to see them and spend time with with them, you'd feel better about going to do that. But you'd also feel better about the woodworking shop in general that basically what you're saying would Yeah, okay, sure. But as we've talked about in the past, Charles, I know that it still takes steps to get there. Right? That wouldn't change overnight. So I think one useful strategies for you and I to work on a step by step plan that would get us to the place of you being able to drive for hours to see your grandkids. So how about we talked about the first step, which sounds like would be to just move things off one bench? Does that sound right? Yeah, that Yeah, one. Okay. That sounds great. Though. So let's talk about that. Then let's let's sketch out what each day would look like so that we won't won't feel overwhelmed like we did in the past. So let's talk about each day and how we would sketch out each day Does that sound good? Sure.","The patient shares their successful experience of making lunch to have with a friend.

What's What's going on there? They think I have a drinking problem. My family.. your family thinks show drinking problem. Yeah. So we really started this was this past weekend. They came to pick me up for my bridal shower. And I was I was drunk when they came to get me so I couldn't go and now everybody's pretty pissed at me. So they asked you to come into the agency. Yeah, you know, I don't want them to hate me or anything. So I agreed to come. Do you believe that you have a drinking problem? I mean, I like to drink. You think It's okay? Yeah. I like I like it like drinking. Come on, you mind if I ask you a few questions related to drinking, that's fine. So, how often do you drink now? Pretty much every day. I drink every day on the weekends for sure. Like, during the week, I'll go to the whatever the best local happy hour is, you know, scope out what's going on. So I'll go after work and have some drinks. What about on the weekend? weekend I gotta keep to myself. still drink a little whatever I have in the house, but I don't really go out a lot of weekend mostly to stay at home and yeah, drink whatever I have there. How much you're drinking, let's say on the weekend it's hard to keep track of thing. Say a couple cases over maybe like two or three cases of beer throughout the weekend. If there's something on sale, you know, at the liquor store down the street, okay, I like a bottle of vodka or something to go along with it. All right, how about during the week? during the week, I just stayed at the bar for a few hours maybe have like, six or seven drinks and then go home. Are you drinking More than you want to? Um, I guess so. I mean, I've kind of tried to make a plan to just say on the weekends to drink some. And that hasn't really kept up because I like to go to the happy hours and stuff. So, so you've tried to cut down before? yeah, it's not really happening. Not really see it happening. Do you have cravings for alcohol? Um, you could say so yeah. I'm at work I want to drink and out doing stuff. I want to drink. So are you using exclusively alcohol or are there other drugs involved? Right now just alcohol and all legal stuff . I was impatient. A couple times for cocaine, but I've stopped. That's not really something I want to do anymore. So when was the last time you're impatient? About four months ago, five months ago, four or five months ago? And at that time you use cocaine. Yeah. I was using And why did you stop using cocaine? Well, I graduated from college, I was kind of a partier in college, and then I had to get a job and it's kind of now had a fear of losing my job because of the cocaine and I'd get a drug test and stuff. So that's kind of in the back of my mind with that. So yeah. I think that the treatment helped with that. You crave cocaine? No, mostly just alcohol. Just how about Your work are you having a trouble keeping your job or your performance your job? Um, I think I'm not doing tip top of what I could be doing but yeah, it hasn't really been a problem. I haven't been threatened to be fired or anything like that. But you know, I'll come in late every once in a while but I I sneak in so nobody notices any social problems because of the alcohol use? Um, with my family kind of right now. Yeah. Not really getting along with them very well. My friends, though, when I go out them during the week where you get along fine, but they're just not really as fun as they used to be. So sometimes, yeah. Sometimes they want to do stuff and go to the movies or whatever. And the ello mad because I don't want to go I'd rather go party somewhere. So you have some social problems. Not so much with your friends a little bit but more with your family more with my family. Yeah. I mean, I guess my friends aren't that happy with me but I don't think it's a huge deal. My best friend I haven't talked to in a couple days because she she is mad at me for not coming to dinner with her the other night because I look rather drunk and I want to do that.  Have you found that you're engaging in any activities are physically dangerous because of alcohol? Um I've gotten hurt a couple times. I mean, fallen down the steps, but I'm not calling like, skydiving or anything, you know? So I did sprained my ankle a couple months ago because I fell on the steps but Okay. Do you find that you have any exacerbation of symptoms you have already? Like any medical or mental health problems made worse by the alcohol? It's a pretty healthy. Yeah, yeah. So did you notice the point after you started drinking when you had to increase the amount that you're trying to get the same effect?  Oh, yeah.  When did that happen? I think I kind of go through phases with it, you know, I'll drink a certain amount for a little while and then I'll notice the I'm not drunk anymore, so I'll have to drink some more. When was the last time you noticed that when you had to drink a lot more to get the same effect. Let's say like, last weekend, you know, I was Got a couple beers in my house and the few hours have passed and I drank probably like, and 12 beers and I wasn't feeling anything. So start drinking a little faster and let us start, you know, feel a little better. How about withdraw? Do you have any symptoms of withdrawal when you stop drinking? Like physical symptoms anxiety? I mean, I want some more. For sure. craving Ok, Jackie, are you open to seeing a counselor here at the agency? I think that's what my mom really wants. So, so maybe they'll try it out once or twice and see what happens but I guess to make her happy. So you are not sure what to try it out. Yeah. I'll get you scheduled to see a counselor. I want to thank you for telling me about what's going on and for answering my questions. It's been helpful. Yeah, sure.","The patient has a drinking problem.

67,"Summarize: Jason, I don't want to be here Im here you're good? So I've been made to come in and talk to you. because something happened on the bus. And there I may have said something to somebody and they're just like, oh, you can't say that. So they actually said, we're going to take you to jail. from jail. They just called me here. Do you know what you're charged with? They didn't explain anything. The government never explains anything. They just don't want me to understand what's going on because they just want to keep me out of captivity. The government. Do you have anyone specific? nope, it's the entire government, entire government, higher government. How long have they been wanting to do this to you? all my life. I've done this all my life. They they're always listening. They're always around. They're always there. always there? always there. Like, for example, they're in the lights right now. They're listening to everything that we're talking about. So that's the reason why I really can't talk about what happened on the bus because they're just going to use that against and then it's locked me up again. I think we take more minutes. Even taking medications. Yes, I take the medication, because if I don't take the medication, government comes and takes me away and puts me into a hospital where they force me the medication. And then the lights are always on and they can always hear everything that I'm saying and what I'm thinking and what I'm going to do. Do you know what they want to do with that information? wanting us to take over the world, to take over the world, people in the world, of course, they want to use everything and use everything that everybody knows to use it against them so that they can actually have the world they want in that baby and make everybody pretend that they don't know what's going on. So therefore, they're using everybody's thoughts against themselves, so that the government can use it to their benefit. So what can you do in a situation? Well, you said the government's monitoring everything and they want to put you in jail. If you don't take your medication, do have any options. Are you stuck? No. So when I'm home, I think I'm perfectly fine because I set up my house in my room to actually make it government proof so that nobody can actually hear see what's going on in there. So when I'm home, I'm perfectly fine. So one option is that being home, being home, you're safe being home and being home I've saved my mom saved my brother's save everybody safe. And being out in the world in the world. That's a nobody safe. Are you safe here? No, I told you they are employed, and they can hear everything that we're saying right now. So no, we're not safe here. It's just not safe here. It's not safe out in the world. At home, you're safe at home and safe in my room, that I mean government. So if you could have your way you would, you would stay home most of the time all the time? I would stay home all the time, but I can't stay home because I mean to go and see doctors and talk to people and do the things that the government needs me or wants me to do. But I don't want to do those things because she's in my thoughts and they're trying to use everybody and get sleep. I can't deal with that. So how how do you know that they're in the lights? Like, how did you discover that? Everybody knows that they're in the light. It's common knowledge. It's common knowledge. Everybody knows that. Do you ever hear things that other people can't hear or see things that people can't see? No, of course, everybody hears the lights talking to you. I don't know what you're talking about. Like everybody hears it. Sometimes it's a whisper. For some people. Sometimes it's a yell. And if you want to not pay attention to what the lights are saying to you, then I don't know what's wrong with you, but everybody can hear it. What's the sound like to you? It sounds like a robot talking. It sounds like we need to know this information we need to what do you do. I'm just making some notes. Speaking some weird progress notes Does that worry you? Yes. where your notes gonna go? Well, this chart will get locked in the chart room down the hall who has access to the chart room. Mostly everybody works here. Can I get a copy of your notes after you're done? Does it worry that there's notes? Yes, because I might trust you. And I don't know if I do yet. But I don't trust the other people who work here because I don't know if they're working for the government, which they probably are working for the government. So they can actually have access to all of my notes and the things that you're writing down, which I don't know what they are, because you're not going to give me a copy of it yet. And I just don't trust that they can actually get that information and because they're going to use it to their advantage and they're going to give it to the government, which I can't have that. So could you please not take notes? I could not take notes, what kind of information and notes are you worried that the government's gonna get? Well, because I made my room at home government proof, I think they're going to try to steal that technology when I actually create it so that they can then disrupt my room and then everybody else's rooms who are just like mine so that they can then use their mind control to then control me to do the things that they want me to do. So without the protection that your house offers, they could control your mind. Correct. Without my room, and without the technology and the systems and the things that I created, then the government will be able to control everything that I do. All right. So can you tell me about your mood through all this, this sounds really stressful you're describing environment where the government's frequently Looking at what you're doing for the feelings are you feel sad or angry? I feel fine You feel fine. I don't really have any problem Yeah, I just I feel fine. I don't feel happy. I don't feel sad. I just, I'm just here kind of resigned the government's gonna do this well, the government's gonna do what they're gonna do anyway. So it doesn't matter if I'm happy sad, pissed off angry. any of that the government's going to make me do what they want me to do anyway. So it doesn't matter how I feel. Are you worried that something is going to happen a similar will happen on the bus? No, because I've learned my lesson to not say those things out loud into to talk about what the government's doing because I can't actually inform anybody else because nobody's listening to me because They're already controlled by the government because they don't have a room like I do at home. To avoid that in the future, because it didn't really, it didn't really work. You weren't able to, to help them understand what's going on. While people don't understand what's going on, then that's their fault. that's their problem. They should have listened to me. And I could actually gave them the technology that they needed to actually create the room so that the government can't hear them. But they weren't open to that idea.  No. Quite the opposite. It is completely opposite. How are your family relationships? Okay. Yeah, we live with my mom. She does that she's supposed to she doesn't go in my room because she knows that. She goes into the robots gonna mess up the technology so she stays out. So you get along through okay. Anybody else you have contact with? friends family? I talk to people all the time, but they are in my head. We have conversations all the time about how we can actually make the world a better place and then how we can actually go through and then destroy the government or do good. Just pump it up. Jason Well, I'm sorry to hear that you're under stress. I'm glad to hear your feel like it's okay. You're not down or anxious or anything. This answer these questions for me this has been helpful. And I'm going to recommend you continue to see a counselor here if that's okay. I realize your court ordered didn't come through. that would be good Well, then I'll put on the schedule. We'll set a time up front, where I'll see you. Let's say in three days. That works? Three days works. Then we'll go from there. Okay. Thanks, Jason.  Thank you.","The patient is paranoid about someone sending them to jail. They feel the entire government is against them and always listening and monitoring the patient. The patient feels they have secluded their home and feel safe there. The patient feels they hear voices from the lights like a robot is talking. The patient denies therapist to take notes fearing government might steal them. The patient feels fine despite them describing a stressful environment of government monitoring. They feel government is going to do what they are going to do anyways, so the patient doesn't feel different. The patient lives with thier mom.

68,"Summarize: Jackie, How are you doing today? Alrght. How about you? I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. I understand you've had some recent difficulties that have brought you to the agency Yeah, I lost my job. You lost your job? Because I failed drug test. You failed a drug test. So I have to drive golf carts sometimes for my job and I just really was not paying attention as I was driving through the parking lot and I hit a car. Then think it was a big deal. It doesn't even leave a big mark. Really. The car owner got pretty pissed about it and I found out that I did it. I got admitted to it. So I didn't want to be getting in trouble for it. So, so then they, since it was an accident, you know, I kind of hit my head a little bit to maybe take a drug test, and I had smoked some weed the night before. So I filled it and was fired. Were you aware that this was an accident? You'd be protesting? Um, you know, I? I don't I didn't know that. Now. I guess they might have told me at some point, but I I probably wasn't paying attention to it or had it I wasn't prepared for it. So there have been consequences to losing your job. Um, yeah, I mean, my parents are not happy. I'm not making any money, obviously. So they, they're not very happy, relying on them for gas money for it. never go anywhere, do anything with my friends ask them for money. So they're kinda, you know, pushing me to get a job and help support myself again. What type of work to do? Um, I work in security, I kind of monitor parking lot, you know, take tickets, things like that. So, most of those employers would require a drug screen. Yeah, that's, that's my problem. I've been trying to look for a new job. And pretty much all of them have required drug tests. So I haven't gotten a new one yet. So that's becoming a problem. So that's why i wanna i want to cut down but I haven't been able to. So I really need a job. I mean, all these things. It's kind of silly that all you know. I find it silly. It should be. Who cares if I smoke a little weed, you know, too. be illegal. But you think it should be illegal? Yeah. So I mean, not causing some harm really, and hurt anyone. So So yeah, I really do need a job. So I'm here to kind of get a handle on that. So you want to stop using marijuana all together? Yeah, I'm gonna have to get a job, I think No, I don't want a random drug test again. All right, can you tell me about your marijuana use now? Like when was the last time used? Um, I actually say now at some friends my roommate this morning. Well, not my roommate but my friend that comes over and stays with me sometimes. And we guys did some this 'morning so. So recently and how about the coke like when did you start using that for how long? long time ago, I've been using proudly for Since I mean, since I was in high school, I started that's kind of just a big part of my life. And my friends do it. My friends do. So, yeah. Any other drugs or alcohol or anything?  Just is just marijuana. Yeah. Have you noticed over time you've been using more? Yeah, I mean you know, I, I try to cut down a little bit I'll kind of say hello, just smoke a little bit and then you know, I'm hanging with hanging out with my friends will end up just being high for a really long time. And let's just all do all night. So. So it's consuming a lot of time.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. kind of always thinking about how I'm gonna get more and trying to get home again. And so it really does take up a lot of time and it's kind of a distraction. So you have a craving for marijuana No, No, I guess not really. Now, have you had any social problems because your marijuana use? let's say other than my work, there's the word mean, my friends I'll do it there's a problem with it. So are there other important activities that you miss out on because of your marijuana use now, I mean, I don't really do a lot so I don't really miss out on much Are there any activities that you engage in that are more dangerous because your marijuana use? this time Out of my basement and don't really do anything. So do you have any history of mental health issues or medical issues?  No. No Do you notice any anxiety or physical symptoms when you stop using my one? No, I feel feel okay. So how motivated are you to stop using? Part of me doesn't really want to, but it's something I have to do. You know, I need a new job and I don't want to be relying on my parents for forever. It's pretty annoying. So I'm pretty committed to it. I would say, Yeah, you're committed to it.  Yeah. I'm gonna get you to see a counselor here if that's okay with you. Yeah, that'd be really helpful. be helpful. I appreciate you taking this time to tell me what's going on and answer my questions has been helpful.

69,"Summarize: Okay, thanks for asking. I understand you've been having some difficulties that have facilitated you come into our agency. Yeah. Well, I mean, I've been drinking a lot more than usual, but it's kind of just part of my life. But I don't know, I think there is an increase. So it's, that's worrying me a little bit. so you feel like you're, you're drinking more than usual. How much are you drinking now? I'm gonna go out with my friends a couple nights a week. Then about once or so we go out with my co workers. So yeah, maybe three, four nights a week, three or four nights a week?  Yeah And how much are you drinking each time to go? Um, you know, kind of depends on who I'm with. But usually when I go out my friends on the weekend, I'll stay for a pretty long time. I mean, I think the problem is when we're going out during the week with my co workers, you know, I'll stay longer than I want to, and then when I have to get up in the morning, it's kind of like I should have gone check out a little earlier, but now they're all out with me. So when I get there, they understand. Alright, so do you know how much alcohol you consume in the time period. Do you know how much you're actually drinking? Each night we approximately I used to drink, like, maybe two beers an hour, but they really like to party so and I was trying to keep up with him. So, friends, yeah. And so I've been drinking like a shot with the beers I have. So maybe like three or four drinks an hour. So do you find that you need to drink more to get the desired effect? Um, yeah, you know, everyone else is getting to that level. So I feel like I need to keep up with them. And usually before I would get that from maybe one or two drinks. So now, I've been working a little bit more, I think,to get there.  Have you made any attempts to cut down on consumption?

But then they invite me and I'm like, Well, I don't want to miss out or my, my friends, you know, it's my show my social time during the week, so so I usually go, they don't really stick to the plan.

Are you are you okay with the amount of time you mentioned that you're using for longer periods? But are you okay with? Or is that something that's distressing you?

I would say like, one of the work just Ready to get finished so I can go go to happy hour with my co workers or, you know, from just kind of at a barbecue or something with family.

Well, usually the important activities involve drinking so that I haven't given up important activities that don't involve drinking. But that's been pretty easy because there's usually alcohol at that point. You haven't missed any important activities. How about engaging in activities that are physically dangerous?  Because I'm also involved now and I'm usually pretty safe. Yeah. So Do you have any medical or mental health history? Um, well, like when I was a kid, I was diagnosed with I think, maybe ADHD or something like that, but I think I teachers were annoyed by me because I was just like, damn good time. So but that's why Got an issue lately some issue now? Has any medical problem or mental health problem become worse because of alcohol? Um No, I started drinking after that so not now it's not become an issue with that. So you mentioned the alcohol use. Has there been any drug use?

She suggested I come. CEO. So why do you think she did that? Um, well, I'm sick, I think. So, we've been running some tests and things and she, she couldn't find anything. So she thought maybe I should come talk to you. I guess maybe my concerns are coming from somewhere else. I think she's That's what she thinks. But I don't know. Maybe whatever illness I have is making me feel this way. So you believe you have a physical illness? Yeah, I just I just know there's something not right. And your physician has run a series of tests. Yeah. We've done like blood work and all the scans and everything. She said she didn't pay anything, but I just I know there's something something. There's something there. So what was her other than coming to Sydney? What was her suggestion for treatment? So she ran tests? She didn't find anything. Yeah, she didn't. She didn't have anything for me. So she's saying there's no physical illness? Yeah, that's what she says. I'm I'm not sure. And I think she's missing something. So how long have you been If that you had a physical illness, um, So about a year ago, you went to her. She started running tests. And there was no findings of a disorder. No, she hasn't found anything yet Was it just one disorder that you thought you had? Or have there been several, um, you know, I kind of started with with Ms. I read some things about about that and how people just people my age to they've had it and they don't even know that they have it and then all of a sudden their life is changed by it. So I was concerned about that. And then I guess after for some tests and things Kind of, I guess, start to think maybe it wasn't that and it was something else. I missed. I think it's cancer. That's one of the bigger scale. Yeah. You know what, even though I don't really have some of the symptoms, you know, can just lie in you and you have no idea. And just one day, you know, your physicians, physicians run tests for all these disorders who thought you had? We think he Yeah, yeah. But, I mean, what if that test that I took a year ago?

So I'm just I'm worried I'm gonna miss something, you know, so I check a lot and check to make sure. So you read you read the form Satya post. Yeah, yeah. About my concerns, and sometimes people get a little frustrated with me. They're not very nice. Tell me about that. Just because I'm not really experiencing anything. They think that I don't have anything to worry about. And they keep telling me but I think I do have to worry about I just have this feeling that there's something wrong. What would you like us to hear that the agency I would just like to feel comfortable that I am not sick. You know, I don't I don't want to worry anymore, but I really think I am. There's something wrong. So yeah, you're worried you have a physical, a physical health disorder. Are you worried? Do you have a mental health disorder? Maybe some people have said that you're worried about that. It's a little concerned that I might be feeling a little extra worried. Maybe that's a symptom of the whenever illness. So concern that the worry could be a symptom of a physical illness. Yeah. So again, what would your what would your goal be here? What do you want? What do you want to change? through counseling?

75,"Summarize: So let's talk about being cognitively active. You know, you're retired now. What did you used to do? I was a nurse for 44 years. Okay. And it was up that kept you very busy. It did it did. It wasn't just that I had five children and I helped my husband run of post office. So I was working 70 hours a week in those days because I did two nights night duty they were 12 hour shifts separated. And and then I worked in the shop. So several jobs. So for five years I did that so that was you know, and looked after the children in the house in that year. Any now that you retired, you do do any voluntary work or Yeah, I've got involved with things around the church with visiting the house bound and taking them out and things like that. And I still am one of my daughters decided to get me a job as a transport passenger assistant for special needs. On the many buses that go around needs. Yeah. So they were desperate for them. And she said, you'll be good at that mum. So that was signed you up. She signed me up. Because she worked. She was the manager. So I did that until I was 77. And I also did they 11 weeks of the stewarding for the abrsm music exams. Yeah. And Have you always been like that? Yeah, yeah. Do you Have a lot of social support. Yes, I do. Yeah. Yeah. Well, even more so now now that the children have press gang me into Facebook and WhatsApp. Wow. I mean, it's just, it's just full on around the world now, you know? You international? Yes, yes. Yes. And I believe that you are an Airbnb host. Yes I do. Yeah. So the world comes to me that way. Excellent. Do you enjoy that? And then I'm Facebook friends when they go home apparently in China and Brazil and Rome, and invitations to visit. And you said you've got grandchildren and great grandchildren. Do you think that intergenerational contact is important? Very important. Why? Because you when you bring up children, you haven't time to see the world through their eyes. Or even really listen to them because you're too busy and preoccupied, but then grandchildren come along and more importantly now great grandchildren and seeing the world fresh through these new eyes is just it's quite mind blowing actually. So I've learned a lot. In the old days, grandchildren used to learn the grandparents knee but nowadays it's the grandparents learning at the grandchildren's knees now definitely Oh, yes. Yes. And do you think it also benefits them to spend time with people of different different generations different ages? Well, as I said they don't see it use age you see, yeah, which is very releasing. Because Well, it just is, you know, after the my generation the way I was brought up, to be seen and not heard and to sit in the parlor with a all these old people. And now, money going around flipping parks, you know, they adventure things and they're saying, Come on the slide with us and all this, you know, which I do. Which I do, I don't turn anything down. That's the secret. not turning things down. Yeah. Just always say yes. Yes. Good philosophy, except drugs, try everything. Try everything once. What's your view on nutrition and kind of, you know, having a healthy diet? I think I think the younger generation stress on it too much, far too much. When when do you think that if my generation are living to be 100 and we were brought up with dripping sandwiches, maybe With marbling in blah, etc, etc, full cream milk, all the rest of it. Why get stressed out? You know, just eat everything in moderation and enjoy life for goodness sake. Yeah. I quite like that phiosophy How do you minimize the effects of stress? Do you have any, you know, did you have any techniques or if something stressful happens? Is there anything particular that you do? gin and tonic Oh, okay. I've got a very good thing if I'm really cross with somebody, and I'd really like to speak my mind to them. I'm very good at writing letters. I don't send the letter to them. But I do write it down and get it out of my system. And I keep it in a drawer in case one day, I might need to plunk it down in front of them. But it's You know, it's off, it's out of my head. And if I need to go to the doctor about anything, I will write down what I want to say to him, because I don't believe they listen to you all the time, especially a woman, if it's a man, Doctor, but you know, whichever they think, Oh, god, it's her again, you know? So I think, put this down and smile at him. He's got to read it. I think you're in your 70s. Do you enjoy being in your 70s? What was your favorite period of you know, in life? If you can, if there's an answer to that? No, there isn't. You should just enjoy every day as it comes and not get hung up about age. Yeah, because I'm surrounded by 90 year olds now. And honestly, they're like, nine years old. We have the biggest laughs and they do the silliest things and you know, we feel as if we've been set free from actual age  You know, you're a mother set an example to the children, right? Oh, you're a daughter, you know? So do you think it makes a difference? kind of moving on from those responsibilities kind of times of life. So when you when you are looking after your children? Is that what you mean by you feel a sense of relief later? Yes. Because you're not, no one's judging you. Except that you're hanging around too long. But apart from that, yeah, no, it's it's good. I mean, I was brought up by a Victorian father who was a bank manager. And it was always just remember who I am in this town. You know, they were somebody in those days. You're my children. And, and then I went to a convent grammar. Just remember who you are girls, your convent grammar school girl, you know, so it didn't leave much to send it It didn't leave much pressure to Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, there's all these pressures as you're going through life. So it's nice to be and my husband died in his 50s so I had to reinvent myself, which was scary. Very scary after being a wife and mother all those years but my goodness me, I think it was either earlier this year or last year you did something quite big for a stranger. Oh, the kidney donation? Yes. In February. This year. Yes. You donated a kidney to a stranger. Yeah, gentlemen, I believe Yeah. Wow. How did you decide to do that? We'll find out about that. And then I found out on Facebook, okay. Don't ask me what the heading was but I'm already like most people donated after death. You know everything. I mean, I'm leaving my body to leave medical school as well, which hasn't pleased one of my daughters, but there you go. How can we agree with you? You're still hanging around? She said. So. So yes, so some of them were for it. And some of them, some of them weren't and haven't going through the transplant the operation is quite a big thing to go through. And I think all last year, I was doing tests, you know, everything from psychological tests to all the physical tests, and brain scans and everything scanned. Yeah, it was, it was better than 1000 mile service. And I thought, well, I'm doing this for the right reasons. I know that, but who knows, they might find something totally wrong with me. And that's the way I found out so it's a win win situation, I believe. Yeah. And you know that if they do accept you, and I was the oldest one that they've ever had this and it'll last 20 years. Apparently, a kidney can last 20 years. That Yeah, that was good. Yeah. So So win win I, I think I've asked most most things on my list that I wanted to talk about, is there anything that you think that I've missed that is worth covering in terms of the theme of living well for longer? Well, I think if you can do something for somebody else for whatever reason, however tiny the comeback to yourself is, is just huge. But as long as you don't look for that comeback, but it just, it just is Yeah. And it also consolidates the reason why you're still alive that you know that you're not just taking up space on the planet. And that, you know, you should do something nice in January hopefully, tanden, Parrish Don't for Alzheimer's. So that's the plan we're animating right? To raise money for ALzheimer's without shame this tandem jump out of a player.  Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, that should be good. not to take life so seriously right? Well, one You don't know how long you're here four and two nobody's that important to you know, the world you're not the center of the universe for goodness sake, you know, so just get on with things and it's like, I feel sorry with Facebook, you know, if they don't get enough likes, you know, it was ruin the day some people well, this is all false. It smoke and mirrors. One thing a friend did say to me that was very important and very proudly was saying that I now own my own house, you see? And she just laughed and she said, Do you think it really? night? Yes. You know? Oh, you taking it with you? Oh, yeah. She said if you don't own anything, she said it's smoke and mirrors all of it. Yeah, and it's true, isn't it? Yeah. So just laughing get over there. Thank you.","The therapist tests patient being cognitively active.

76,"Summarize: So I understand that you've come in because you're having a little difficulty in your relationship about that. So, basically, it's been getting a little bit worse since we got married. We got married about a year and a half ago. And, you know, the the woman that I married, I thought we were both kind of independent people. And I thought that we would kind of go our separate ways or thing like we used to college, but it's kind of gotten to the point now where it's like, I just want my own personal space and I I don't want to be left alone sometimes. Alright, so you're looking for independence in your relationship. Now, how long have you been together? About a year? total four or five years, married for a year and a half. And when Franklin Did you notice that? What you kind of think it was the problem like the independence, lack of independence?  I guess kind of once we got married after that, it seemed like, you know, we were spending all of our time together, which, you know, at first was great because we're newlyweds, you know, we love spending time together and everything, but I guess probably about, you know, six months to a year after we first got married, it's kind of, you know, progressed to the point where, you know, now it's just kind of becoming like a burden that whatever I do, she's always there with me. We're always spending every waking moment together and sometimes it's just nice to have My own personal space is freedom, you know. So you're looking for that freedom. Sarah, this kind of resonate with you? Can you can you tell him that? So Frank, what's it like to hear that? It kind of Reminds me of how it used to be, you know, like, she said, we've been dating for four or five years and, you know, back then it It wasn't a problem, you know, she could go out and do her own thing I could go out and do my own thing to not have to worry about each other but now that we're spending every moment together, you know, it's just I'm always worried about her she's always worried about me and you know, when when I do get the chance to go you know, hang out with some friends or something like that. It always feels like, you know, I've pressure on me because I should be with her. She shouldn't be there with me, you know, and I feel like I'm doing the wrong thing by trying to be independent try to go do things by myself. I feel guilty. I do. So, Sarah, Do you sense that and, frankly, feels guilty about that? You feel rejected. this a little bit after. So, like I said, probably the first six months to a year it was it was really good. But then, you know, reselling is kind of a burden. You know, just always spending time together and trying to make amends and try not to get into fights because we're always spending so much time together. So you mentioned that the six months to a year has been the same for you like was the beginning of the marriage, something different to what you have that So for you a couple months after that initial phase. So around the same time you started experiencing this difficulty in the marriage Okay, are you okay with some space? You don't seem real certain. So maybe this, this idea of space isn't really something you feel will work for you. Do want to try to address Frank's concerns about the space? You seem apprehensive about it. So maybe just experiment with it, try it for one night and see what happens. So, in the year and a half, you've been married, Is there ever been a night when you've gone out by yourself? Yeah, it's been a couple, especially earlier on, which is nice, you know, just, you know, getting to see old friends and you know, our old college friends, like, of course, we attended, you know, events together and like seeing old friends and everything like that, but there's been, there's been a few times, you know, not, not more than I can count on both my hands, but there's been a few times where I've, you know, gone out and just had, like, you know, a guy's night or something. Okay, and what would happened, like in terms of like between you, so, just getting out of the house is basically the hardest part. You know, just finding a way to ensure That, you know, it'll be okay. I'm going to be back home later on in the night that she doesn't need to worry about me, you know, if I have any trouble or anything pops up that I need her help, I'll let her know. And, you know, just knowing that I love her and telling her that I love her and making sure that she knows that I'll be back. But you know, sometimes it's hard because she just gets upset when I tell her that I'm leaving and she doesn't want me to go and she would rather me stay or even take her with me. And you know, I don't want to be the only guy that shows up with my wife. You know, everybody else left their wives at home also. So I don't want to be the odd man out all right, so this is really an experiment that's already been tried. tried twice. Yeah, yeah. Just Just a few times. Is there any reason to believe that if you try it next week, it'll be different? That's not good. Don't you don't think so. Well yeah. mean, we've been doing it, you know, the past couple months, but it seems like every time we do is you know the same result it's her getting worried about me and you know me trying to find a way to assure her that it's gonna be okay and you know that we're so married we're still in love, you know everything like that, but, you know, it's just, I really want my space and it seems like sometimes I just can't get out of her crib. Sir, what do you think about that? All right. So in terms of the going out, although going out with your friends wouldn't have to be on the weekend that something could happen during the week. Yeah, absolutely. You know, a lot of my friends normally go out during the week because you know, they have their families and everything to take care of on the weekend. So, yeah, I could definitely go out tonight during the week. Okay, so you could agree. The both of you could agree to that as kind of terms of this behavioral experiment or weekends, you'll spend those weekends together. I think we could try that. Because that was a concern you specifically brought up. How about Sarah, how about the times during the week? How do you feel about those? You feel like you'd respond better to that? Would that be a better experience? Something that you think that you could try next week. So, let's talk about when because you've gone out before and you said it was just getting out. Getting out the house that was the, the real challenge right? So walk me through. This really goes through both of you. What we through what happens when you're when you're getting ready to leave when you're planning to head out? So you know, usually I'll go get dressed I'll let her know where I'm going you know, give her my cell phone number you know somebody else's phone number in case my phone is off. Just basically tell her what we're going to do you know whether we're going out to to a pole or you know, going to watch some sporting event or something like that. No, I would tell her what we're doing, you know, just so she knows and knows where she can find me. But then after that, it seems like as soon as I assure her of what we're doing, and when it's happening, when I'll be home, everything like that, it just seems like all the progress I made towards the front door kind of gets pulled back a little bit because like, she doesn't want me to leave, you know, I can see in her eyes that she's not very happy about me leaving her. And that kind of makes me feel guilty, you know, because I don't want to leave her alone. I want her to be more independent. I kind of want her to, you know, if I'm going out, I would like her to go out as well. You know, she says tons of friends. You know, we both have friends. We both have our social circles. And she's kind of it's frustrating when I can't go do my thing, because she's always got to be with me. So ultimately, after all that you you do go, but you feel feel guilty. And do you have a good time? Most of the time, right? Do you know, sometimes I just can't get over the fact that you know, my wife at home who's upset at me, and that makes me upset. You know, it's just a matter of finding the balance between, you know, my independence and her, you know, doing her own thing because I would like her to do that as well. So sometimes you have a good time sometimes you don't. You're worried about Sarah being home. How about when you come home? When I come home, usually things go back to normal. I mean, we've definitely had our exchange of words after a few times me coming back. But most of the time it goes back to normal, which you know, it's fine. We're very loving, affectionate couple. So that's awesome. But you know, most the time it's just overbearing. Is that how you see it Sarah, the way Frank described it? so how about one is out? Like so after after he's left? What do you What are you thinking that? Like? You're anxious something bad's gonna happen. Do you think that there's been any reason for that thinking, like, do you think there's any basis for thinking something bad's gonna happen?  Absolutely not. No, no, I love Sarah you know, the five years that we've worked together been great, you know, it's it's just where we are now as opposed to where we first were, and when we first got married, it's it's changed and you know, I would just like some independence just like to be on my own sometimes. And I guess I don't always relay that well to her and she doesn't understand why I want my space. I want to go hang out with my friends, but I've been trying to explain to her that, you know, it's, it's a two way street. It's not just all one way and so we have to work on these issues. And you know, that's why we came to you. Alright, so you're really frustrated by not being able to go out, go out. But you're anxious about when he goes out. So we talked about the possibility of like an experiment or you go out sounds like we might run to the same difficulties you experienced before. What can we change to increase the chances of that experiment working? So, so if you called when he was at Piedmont The answer is that's something that's normally possible. Yeah. Yeah. Most of the time, I'm very good at responding to, you know, making sure that she knows I'm okay. Making sure that she's okay. So that's a compromise, you'd be willing to make. Absolutely something like that.  Yeah. You need any other reassurances from Frank, Sarah? Do you have a plan to call Frank? Like when he's out? Or is it something that you would do if you just felt the need to or Were you calling for some specific reason? Why don't you start reinsurance? Everything's going right. Okay, so that seems reasonable to you. Right? I mean, I, I guess but at the same time, like when I'm out doing my own thing, you know, I kind of want that privacy in that, you know, just being in the moment you know, because I know when I get back home, from back with you and I'm, nothing's changed because I've always been with you like we're still married. But when I'm out with my friends, and you know, I'm getting a couple phone calls during you know, the night over the course of the night and it's having to deal with my wife and having to make sure that she knows I'm okay and everything like that it it gets a little frustrating. It's a little, I mean, frustrating Would that be a good compromise? It was a text or two. I guess. That's better than a phone call, right? Yeah. So not ideal, but you can see how it might decrease your anxiety a bit. Right? And maybe work toward a little bit more freedom. So that's how I can experiment you both combined to try. Okay, so we could try and try it out. Alright. So it's not a perfect plan. But it's one that you know, I would hope that we could be successful with if you could, though, you're going through it, maybe track what happens, right, from your own perspective, like what you were thinking, the fact left, what you were thinking when you left, how it went, how that separation kind of was conducted. And what happened. Same thing when, while you're out how many times you texted her If you called and then what happened when he got back? Right? That's just kind of, and you can you can keep a record of those things just independently. You know, you write it down Come your experience and you write down your experience. And we'll come back next time. No matter what happens with it, we'll compare and kind of see what see what happened and how we could make adjustments to to make it work even better.","The patients got a married one and a half years ago. They have been having trouble with their personal space, being independent and the lack of it, both. Frank has issues to do things independently as he feels pressure to be with her. It makes him feel guilty. Sarah feels rejected. The patients have experimenting hanging out separately twice and it hasn't worked out well. Frank expresses that he feels the need to assure Sarah when he is out, and Sarah feels anxious for the time when Frank is out. Sarah agrees a couple texts and a phone call when Frank is out will help. The therapist asks to note down these experiences before the next meeting of how they both feel, and it can be discussed in the next session. "
77,"Summarize: between here and there, obviously, if it were easy, you wouldn't need me, you wouldn't have 13 therapists. If this were easy you would have been to a life you wanted a long time ago. So it's obvious that it's easy it already be done. Because it sounds like you're a person with a lot of motivation works really hard, because there are very few people who wouldn't quit before 13 therapists. So that's a very good quality. The very fact that you've gone through all these therapists is a good sign for us. Nonetheless, it is difficult. between here and there, there's going to be hell. Exactly. Right. So I figure our number one priority has to be to get you to stay alive through house so that we can get to the life you want. If that's where we're at. Now. We got to have some sort of agreement, not by writing a contract. Because I'll fire you if you try to kill yourself that because we both sort of have to face the fact that to get there you got to go through there and to go through there you got to stay alive. Okay what you guarantee that you can get you can call me and I'll guarantee I'll get myself What are you gonna do if I fail? Beside break Mike. Okay. So if I don't help you, you'll kill yourself. Yeah, okay, but if I do help you Well","The therapist assures the patient that they are strongly motivated to have met 13 therapist to want a life they wish for. The therapist asks the patient that if they want to get where they wish to, they need to stay alive."
78,"Summarize: Okay, how are you? Good. Thanks for asking. I understand you've come here today to the agency because you had a recent arrest. Yeah, I got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, alcohol and marijuana. How recently was this DUI? About a week ago? Okay, so what's been going on when that happened? Um, well, I am going to have to go to courtsoon. And I know that I'm probably gonna have to go I'd like treatment or something like that, but I really just don't want to. So I just, I'm just coming here becauseI don't know maybe I can like get out of it if I'm gettingsome type of treatment. But yeah, get out of it. You mean get out of the charge? Yeah. I mean, I feel like they're probably gonna make me like go to like rehab or something like that. And I don't want to do that. So you feel like you can get out of the rehab or two. I don't know. I really am not sure. So at this recent arrest, you realize it may be a value to stop using which really don't want to Yeah, stuck there. Yeah kind of when you drink Do you ever socialize the same time? I mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most of the times just like at my house alone so do the marijuana yeah I mean I like a few people that are like smoke with but usually just kind of like by myself and myself every day so it was with people so it doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using now early sweetie losing um this this alcohol and I want to take it for pain relief qualities Yeah.  Any other reasons um it's just easier forget about problems Yeah. So affects your mood in a positive way. Yeah like I get like I like the feeling once I'm drunk Have you use since you had to do it? Um, I haven't drank but I've as a situation.  So you have the use it takes away pain for you to take swings xiety feels good. But then you have these consequences of the law. And you figure those two things out. I don't know. I don't know if there is what was your wealth of knowledge. So like not as just You can imagine that. So it was a good the other side. Can you imagine having further it says law enforcement like more charges in the future. I guess I hadn't really considered that. So you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not a really heavy consequence. And you'll be more careful in the future. I don't know. Yeah, I guess so. So with that thinking, you continue to use as you were, that you would take out the part that got you in trouble. Yeah. First you have to get out of trouble this time. Yep. So if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana, would you continue to use it? I just couldn't imagine So there's a social component here. Yeah, a little bit. I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like nine five jobs. They don't drink every day. But I do. But like on the weekends, like all of my friends who I So even if you had no anxiety, no pain You'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends. How would they respond if you went out with them? I didn't drink. Um, they probably just like wouldn't understand it, because we all go out and we get like really drunk and So it'd be socially awkward. straining the relationships with your friends. So the quitting alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you know. But then you have this distressing situation which is making you second guessed some of it. Yeah, I mean, it's making me think that like, maybe I, I need to, like make a change. I just can't see that. That's the change I'm making. So you need to make some change. Yeah, but not the alcohol. Drugs. Yeah, yeah. Something else could change. Yeah, I don't know what but So you could reduce your usage, avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal. Would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety of the pain? Am I just not going anywhere ever? I might not drive as often So that strategy might not work. That's something you've been tossing around though, this idea of isolating a little bit more, and drinking a little less. Seems like all your options here kind of grim. Yeah, that's just that's just me doesn't seem that way to you too. Now that I'm like talking through it, yeah. I'd like don't think I have any choice really have any choice? What's going to happen is going to happen? I don't know. All right. So let's start with the lead now. Pick up with me now. You don't want to make it bad impression in this whole court proceeding with a DUI. What do you think you could do that would make a bad impression? Um, go to court drug I would do it. Get another DUI in the meantime, that was not good either. So you want to avoid those behaviors for sure. So you know, for sure you don't want to have sex? Would it be acceptable those things anyway? I mean, not really. I mean, I think I should avoid does not like drunk driving enough. Or maybe not during the day of my court date, So would you appreciate those skulls like avoiding those situations I go in the court truck Yeah. Goals that you could get behind I mean, I can try I guess to like think about it and Charlie get out now I'm gonna be stressed out ate my court date. It's gonna be hard to like not drink that day. You're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea. Now this is really tough for you is the outcome. The marriage laws are important. Yeah, this whole this book, do you I think it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed. Yeah. So is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life with fat that is gonna change things I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it then just dealing with it. I mean, if I like don't go to court or anything that's like a worn out for me like I can't, I can't avoid this situation. But if there's a condition of your treatment, the judge says no more drinking is no more marijuana period. We can see that that if you obey those rules or word, jail now, I couldn't get to that. I know it possibly could probably well, but I was I don't know. I would think it almost certainly would have happened. Yeah. I don't know what I'm gonna do. back a couple of steps. How long have you been using the alcohol marijuana? For about like, six years, six years. Have you ever until now with the DUI, have you ever envisioned stopping? Now, what's your plan? Like pre d? Why was your plan and all this? I just had dinner like the jerking kind of has gotten worse. Yeah. So without this or something you would have continued using? Yeah, I didn't really have any like until now. Yeah. Could this be a strange way like an opportunity? I mean, I guess if I had if I wanted to stop by this would be a way for me to stop or reason for me to stop. If you really wanted to stop because your stuff I don't know. you could give a shot. You're just not sure you could. You could actually do it. Yeah, I mean, I've never tried to before so I don't know.  It's just unknown. Yeah, yeah. So where do you want to go from here you have this to you, I imagine a hearing or some type of Coming up here to see me. What can I do to help you? Um, like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality. Yeah. Okay, you want to work on that? Yeah. So between now I'm gonna see you again. Do you have any hearings or anything coming up? Now they're not for like a few more weeks, few weeks. So I'll see you again. And I have the IEP and everything here. second week. Let's pick up with that. They think changes we're hearing is moved up to slumping, okay. Okay.  Thanks for helping. Thank you.","The patient got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol and marijuana about a week ago. The patient is not losing any social support by stopping to drink since they do it alone. They do it for pain relief and feeling good. There is a little social component of drinking with friends during the weekends. The patient has been drinking and using marijuana for six years now. The patient hasn't really considered to stop using, but they feel they can if they intend to stop. The therapist offers to meet again since the court hearing is not for another few weeks. They promise to have IEP and other things in the second week and pick up with that.  "
79,"Summarize: Amanda, thanks for coming in tonight. yeah its okay The GP sent me a letter telling me a little bit about what's been happening. That's been having some difficulties since birth for some of you weeks ago. Tell me a little bit about what's been happening from your it's been really difficult. I've been really struggling. And I don't know why. I don't know why. This should be a really wonderful time for me and it's something that I've been looking forward to But it hasn't. It hasn't been a good time. I could never have imagined that it would be like this. It is not what I thought it would be like,  what has what has it been like for you? I'm just not feeling how I think I'm meant to feel. It's difficult sometimes, to me to actually do what I'm meant to do. As a mother I, and it just feels so wrong. I'm so wrong? This isn't how I meant to be. I feel like I'm just meant to love looking after him and taking care of him, but he doesn't feel it's just not feeling that way. And sometimes it's even hard to want to.  It's meant to be feeling this Yeah. And this is something that we've been trying so long for and it's Just been so important for both of us. These this thing that has been so important, and now that it's, it's here, now that's happened. It's different to the way that you imagined  slightly different. I thought that I kind of blossoming and just love Detroit and I do love him. It's not that I don't you know, it's not that I don't love him. It's not that I don't want to do this, I do it. This is part of me that is just really struggling. Please tell me a little bit more about that part that's struggling. It's really difficult to even talk about because it's like, not meant to feel this way. But there's this part of me that would just not like to get out of bed. In the mornings, I just want to sleep. I don't want to do anything.  Just want everything to go on? It's really hard to admit because I can't imagine that anybody else could understand what this feels like it, it feels unnatural, almost that kind of relief to say it out loud. And this is the place that you can say what needs to be said. Yeah. Yeah. That is part of me that almost feels angry with all the stuff I've got to do, and I don't feel like I'm getting the support that I need. And it's really difficult. I feel like I have to do it all myself.  So, feeling as though it's all on you. You're going to deal with it all the time.  Yeah, and it's Huge it's like this little little boy that just needs me to be there. I'm struggling to be there and until want to be there even. So it's really overwhelming. Mm hmm. By yourself with my partner, John's Bay like, he tries, but I think he is getting frustrated with me, too. He's sensing that. I guess he had expectations of how I would be and how we would be and how this would be and I think that he's disappointed in me. And then that doesn't help and so then I sort of feel like I have to do it to prove that I am okay and that I am kind of holding it all together. And I do love these.  So trying to keep a mask up. Trying to seem as though it's okay. Yeah. You caught him. To know how I feel I'm I feel like I'm a bad mother already. But it's painful. It's a painful feeling. I've been tried so hard to have this child to have wanted and it's always been talking about and planning for so long and it means so much to john as well. And I'm just it's just, it's just not happening. either of us thought and I really wanted to, it's hard because I wanted to but so at this point, and it's six weeks, they've been a really rough. Six weeks feels to me like really rough. Having waited so long to have this child gone through the birth and understand from a GPM pump was a somewhat difficult birth if it wasn't from I thought it was. So from the very start, it hasn't been as you thought.And now you're at that point where the reality is the reality of this baby. It sounds to me that there's a struggle going on for you. But a struggle that you're feeling very much alone with",The patient complaining about her feeling that she was wrong. She has insecurities with her partner. Patients expectations are hurting badly.

And you seem really pleased about that as well. And so, you know, I think today we've run through a couple of more techniques that you can use to manage your anxiety. And it seems to me that you've got a good grip on those.  Yes. Yeah, definitely. I think today was really helpful. Good. That's fantastic. Well, I guess if we wind up now, and then meet again, next week. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But um, did I did I tell you actually, that I had an argument with my mom on Thursday. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. It was a really, really big one. Yeah, I am. Yeah. I mean, what happened was basically that mom, mom, she was just getting really angry at me for Dave again, because you know, we've been going out for three months and it's time I've told you before. Really, really, really doesn't like him. Ohh really? Yeah. And she was, she had to go in for the drugs again. And then she was saying, you know that I can do so much better. And she was just, you know, like, Oh, I really screaming at me and I had to take all of that and, you know, people were just going around in circles in circles. And it was really, really not not very, not very good that I had listened to her saying that.  Yeah, I can imagine so he has been really upset by that. Yeah, I was because, you know, she. Well, you know, that I mean, I really like Dave, I think that is really good. And, and, and, and I would, I would, I would, I would, I would like to keep on seeing him but that she disapproves of him. And I find it really hard. It's just proof of him. Yes, I can see that really causes you more anxiety as well that this is happening and yeah, you feel criticized by your mom and perhaps torn a bit between your mom's view and David? Yeah, I do. You talk to him. While she doesn't, she doesn't want me to talk to him. about it because she doesn't want him to know that she doesn't like him. And then you know, he doesn't really like her as well, because she thinks he thinks that she's a snob. And so it's really hard. You know, I just feel like I'm sort of, sort of in the middle and like in between the two of them. Yeah. But so felicity. I'm very pleased that you didn't have a panic attack last week. Yeah. And and so are you. Yeah. And I'm hoping that the work that we did today, in looking at a couple more techniques of how you can manage the anxiety has been helpful to you. Yeah, I think I'll be able to give it a practice this week. Good. And we've discussed your homework. Yes. So expert welding perhaps if we wrap up for today. All right. What did it do? I tell you that I had an argument with my mom on Thursday. No, yeah, an argument with mom and it was really bad because she was just yelling, yelling, yelling in your with about Dave. I've told you about Dave before because she doesn't like Dave and she was having a got me for the drug. You know, cuz he takes the drugs and she was just yelling at me because she doesn't like that he takes the drugs, but the student doesn't understand that. I mean, I just want to be with you. And so but because she doesn't like him see, you know, sister, she was yelling at me about that on Thursday, I can see that this is very upsetting for you. felicitated is an issue that you've raised before. So I'm wondering whether we should decide that for next week, we'll start to discuss these issues that you're having with your mom so that we can work out a plan when we've got our next session. How would that be?  Well, this one, this one, I mean, the argument was, when she was saying she was saying to me that I should leave him. And she was saying, you know, that I could do a lot better and that I really shouldn't be with him. And I should just leave she was saying, but you know, and then she wouldn't let me you know, because I wanted to talk to him about it, and she wouldn't let me talk to him about it. And because I really don't like each other, I just I'm really sort of stuck in the middle. And I can see that that's a really big issue. So I think we definitely will put this on a number one agenda for next week. Okay. And so We'll work on a theme because this is clearly very important to you. Yeah. And I think that we're going to need a good chunk of time to be able to help you to resolve some of these issues with your mom. I can't How about during the week on? In addition to the other homework you have, you have to think about what the issues are that you would like to raise with me next week about this. Okay. All right. So we can spend, we can spend most the next session talking about it. It sounds like that's going to be a very important thing to do, because I can see how distressed This makes you feel. Okay, ready?  Yeah. Yeah. All right. Okay. Okay. So we'll meet again, same time next week. Thanks Felicity.","Therapist trying to use new techniques on an old patient. Patient's mom was not accepting Dave, that creates a problem. Her mom getting angry and go in for the drugs. Mom doesn't approve Dave for the patient. It makes patient anxious. Patient's mom and dave doesn't like each other that makes more anxious. Patients mom doesn't like dave doing drugs so she started yelling at patient. Patient had stuck in the middle between mom and dave. Therapist will keep it as a first agenda in next session and therapist will analyse and  clarify it completely."
81,"Summarize: Okay, Felicity, before we start to talk about what you've come here to see me for today, I just wanted to raise an issue with you. I think we both realized when you walked in here that we've seen each other before.  Yeah, I'm Jake's mom. I've seen you at kindy.  That's right. That's right. We do run into each other, a fair bit at the kindergarten. So I suppose what that brings up for me is that I'm a psychologist, and there is certain boundaries that I have to uphold with my clients. And I think that we need to talk about what we're going to do about this, that we we do see each other quite often and how we're going to manage that in terms of, you know, keeping those appropriate boundaries within therapy and outside the therapy room. Okay. Yeah.  So how I say this, we have a few different options. The first one is that we could decide not to engage in therapy together. Given that, you know, there could be some issues when we see each other outside of therapy. Okay, how would that option sit for you?  Well, um, I guess, part of the problem for me is that I really, I feel that I really need to talk to someone about what's going on for me and I don't really, there's no one else in town I can talk to okay.  Yeah, psycho psychology services are quite limited in this area. Yeah. Okay. So you really feel that you need the help and this is the only option that you've got. So given that that's the case. How do you think we could manage this one we do run into each other outside of the therapy rooms so that we don't cross over you know, the boundaries of therapists and clients. So if I see you at the kindergarten shall we acknowledge each other and you know, keep walking or how would you like to manage it?  No, I mean, I think I think it's good if you know if we can, like say hi and stuff, but I mean, I probably Probably wouldn't want to talk to you at kindy about what we do here in case other people hear it. Sure, sure. And I'm really glad that you brought that point up, because I think that, given that we will run into each other quite a bit at the kindergarten, it's fine for us to acknowledge each other, but we do need to keep the therapeutic issues that we talk here in therapy for therapy. Yeah, yeah. I'm glad that you think that it that would not be appropriate.  Yeah. Yeah.  And I mean, you wouldn't, you wouldn't tell anybody other moms, would you? No, no, I'm, I would definitely keep it confidential, that we're in a therapeutic relationship together. Nobody else needs to yet be aware of that. Okay.  So it's kind of like, we've got therapy for in here, but then out there. We're just mums.  That's exactly right. So if we could just keep it at you know, those things separate then I don't think we should run into any problems in therapy. Yeah, but perhaps we could check in from time to time to see you know, whether that It's becoming a problem for  Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good.  Do you think that sounds okay? Yep. All right. So now that we've discussed that issue, yeah. Let's talk about why you've come in to talk to me today.  Okay.",The therapist had seen patient in kindergarten. Patient was there to take a therapy. Patient stated to a quick talk with therapist. There were very less therapist in the area. Patient befriend with therapist to say hi and stuff. Therapist said that the therapy was confidential and its between therapist and patient only.

84,"Summarize: Hello, Sophia.   Hi. How are you doing today? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. I saw you last time a week ago. And I know you've had some concerns with employment working on employment. The first before we get into that I wanted to check in and see how you're doing emotionally. I know from last week, on a scale of one to 10 you said you were suffering from depression at about seven. Yeah. How is it today? It's been it's been up and down. I think today, it's probably a seven again. But you know, I've been back down to a nine lately. I guess maybe I feel a little better because I'm coming here. And I know, we'll get to talk about it a little bit. But I guess you know, last time we were talking about me trying to get a job and live full time job. And I think I just realized last week that it's really hard for me to work full time right now. You know, I'm doing the part time thing with the work program, and they want us to do volunteer work in the afternoon, if we haven't found a full time job by a certain week. And I just, you know, just thinking about it, and I just don't think I can do that. I just don't think I can work for eight hours every day. It's just too much. So you're having some concerns about full time work and that level of energy, you'd have to exert that commitment. Alright, so we'll be okay today, if we kind of structured, what we're going to do sure for for this session. So, if it's okay with you, I'd like to talk about that. Okay. All right and and get some more details about kind of what's going on this week and your feelings surrounding that. And we touched on this a little bit in the last session. But I'd like to talk about kind of your core beliefs, your central beliefs that might be contributing some of these feelings of depression. Yeah. And then, for the last part, we'll work on like we did before, interventions to try to help you with with what's going on at work and with your depressed mood. And we can make changes to this as needed. I just want to start with an outline that we can, we can have going in okay. So make sense. Okay. Anything you want to add or take away from that? No, I mean, that makes sense. Okay. So, tell me a little bit more about what's going on with the work. Well, I mean, I don't really know why it is. I know I'm always tired because I just I have so much trouble sleeping, as I told you before. It's just It doesn't matter how tired I am, I can't sleep, but it's just I go, I go in the morning, you know, eight to noon, but then in the afternoon, it's just like, it's so hard to keep going on. It's just such a long amount of time. And I just feel like, I don't know if I can really do it. And especially in the winter, you know, if you work eight hours, by the time you get out of work, it's dark out and it just makes my depression so much worse. So, the latter part of the day is more of a struggle for you. 
 Yeah, a lot of hard work day. So getting up in the morning and getting to work on time. You do okay with that. It's hard. It's hard, but I feel like I'm better at that. I'm better at it. I'm already up anyway. So, you know, I know I gotta get up. I gotta do what I have to do. So the work program you're in now, you work in the morning? Yeah. What hours are you there? Eight to noon. And there's some work you have to do in the afternoon. Well, yeah, since I've been there for what is it eight weeks. And I haven't found a job yet. They want us to volunteer in the afternoon and they find us our own place of volunteer. So that's good. I don't have to find that myself. But I guess they want to get you used to doing something for eight hours a day and maybe you have something to put on your resume. And guess what? have like a big gap in your resume that doesn't look good either. So haven't been able to say a work tear even though I didn't make money. But just thinking about it, it's so exhausting. And you know, I get out of the work program and I think if I did go to, I can barely make it home. It's just so all I want to do is go home. Thinking about it's exhausting. Can you tell me what type of thoughts you're having? I just don't think I can do it. Like, I just don't think I'm the kind of person that can work eight hours a day. And it just makes me feel like what's the point like, I'm going to work eight hours a day. I don't think I can just there's just too many hours. Yeah.","The patient had visited earlier regarding depression and was diagnosed. Therapist asked to rate the depression on a scale of 1 to 10. She gave the same answer 7 as earlier. Earlier Patient was struggling to get a full-time job but now she had a problem with this full-time job. Pateint thinks that she can't work for 8 hours a day. This topic was covered last week so therapist starts to talk about the core beliefs which contributing to this depression. Patient was tired of the job and having trouble in sleep because of work shifts. In winter, depression becomes worse because of the darkness. Patient was not getting any job opportunities and didn't make money. Patient is exhausted by this work. Patient don't think that she can work for 8 hours a day. That's too much."

87,"Summarize: Hello, Mr. Taylor. My name is Dr. vinita. And I'm one of the psychiatrists who works here right. Okay, can you tell me what's brought you here today? Yeah, well, I was referred to by my GP, right. They referred me to you because. Well, my wife thinks I'm drinking too much. I see, do you think you're drinking too much? Well, I Right? Maybe we can just explore that a little bit more. Yeah. How much would you say you drank in a day? Now? Yeah. Oh, It has crept up over the years. Well, I suppose if I'm, if I'm honest. Yeah, I drink about a bottle of vodka a day about bottle of vodka. And how long have you been drinking that much for? Well, as I say it's crept up on for Few years now, a few years, can you make it a more specific two years? Three years? Five years? Well, I mean, as I say, it's crept up. I mean, initially, I just used to have a couple of drinks after work, right? Because I got a pretty responsible job. And I just found the drink calmed me down, you know. And then I got more responsibility, and I found a bit more alcohol helped me so. Yeah, yeah. So drinking about it. Okay, so you'd say of about the last two years three. Okay. And do you drink anything else apart from vodka? Yeah. After work, I normally go to the pub and have two to four pints of bitter or lager. Right. Okay. And would that be every day? Yeah. Well, especially, you know, Monday to Friday when I'm working. But at weekends, I normally go down the local pub At lunchtime, right and how much is a few? Okay, and about two to four. Right.  Okay. And then so on a weekday I've got about you take about you have about two to four pints afterwards and then you come home and drink about a bottle of vodka. Yeah, well, no, well, no, I don't come home and drink a bottle of vodka. I drink a drink during the day. So when you drink drought when I'm working mind, you know when you're working lunchtime, okay, when I'm at work, when do you start drinking during the day? On an average day, when after I'm up and dressed and have me breakfast. Right. So after breakfast, and again, when did that start?  Couple years ago, a couple of years ago.  Okay. And what about the weekends at the same at the weekend? And would you drink you go to the pub at lunchtime at the weekend? Would you drink more than a bottle of vodka during the day or the weekend? No. It'd be about the same. Okay, and then the rest regular time when you drink more than what you tell me.  No. Okay, so And is it just beer and vodka? Or do you drink wine? No, no. We used to drink wine my wife used to when we had an evening meal together. Sometimes we had a bottle of red or a bottle of white together. half a bottle. But since she started complaining that she thought I was, you know, really shoving it down my throat. She sort of nailed on the head. So don't do that anymore. Then would you say you have to drink more to get the same effect from the from the alcohol? Same common, some common effect? Do you have days where you don't drink or periods where you don't drink? When was the last time you had that? A few months ago now. When she really had a go at me and I thought to myself, well, maybe I'll give it a try. Again. It wasn't the first time but um for how long did that last for about three days and it In that time did you experience any? any physical feelings at all? Dude, I mean, I was shaking. very shaky. I got I was on edge all the time. I was not working properly, and I was sweating. And I just felt absolutely lousy. Yes. take time off work. No, I didn't take time I couldn't do I didn't dare take time off work. I just said I had a bit of a cold, right. But I thought to myself, well, I can't carry on like this. And so I had a couple of largers on the work. And that made that made you feel better on the straight and narrow. Did you ever feel? Do you ever get those similar sorts of feelings in the morning when you wake up? Yeah,  you do. And what happens yet when you have a drink in the morning that makes you feel better? Does, right? Yeah. If you don't have that drink in the morning, what happens over the time I get to work I just feel. Again, I feel pretty shaky and very on edge. And as I say I don't touch it when I'm at work. Got a pretty responsible job. And I do, as I said, Don't touch it at work, and you work as a bank manager. I do  Okay. Has anyone has anyone commented apart from your wife about your drinking? Have you ever had any more serious health problems from your drinking? Have you ever seen a doctor or had sometimes people get loss of memory or Fitz Shams? Very serious shakes, they need to go into hospital. He does some blood tests. And did that show anything? It wasn't too good. Right?  And then I because of my you know, my wife friend to leave me basically. That's what got me to see the GP. Oh, he did some blood tests. And he said your liver, you know, told me I've got to cut it down a bit. What did he say about a room and he said he was going to refer me to somebody to talk about it. Right. Okay. And how did you feel about that? Well, I wasn't exactly over the moon when he suggested it. But um Well, I suppose you know if it's a choice of coming to see you, and then or my wife leaving me. I came to see, I don't want to lose her. So I can see that it's had quite an impact at home. Yeah, well, but outside the home, how's your drinking affected jobs or anything else? My job about relationships other than your wife with family friends? Well, any other serious consequences? Yeah, I have to go to family dues dragged along there. But I mean, I don't I mean, I avoid mixing with my work colleagues socially. I find that bores me, because if I'm in the pub with them, I've tried it once and I found I needed a drink and you know, I thought, well, I'm going to put my foot in it if I carry on like this. I left early, and I just make excuses. I don't I don't socialize with them anymore. Okay, thanks for coming to talk to me today.","Patient is addicted to drinking for the past few years.

89,"Summarize: Hello, Sarah, how you doing today? All right. I understand that you've come to counseling because you have a particular issue that's been bothering you recently. Yeah, I've been I've been really stressed out at work. I just I'm getting to the point where it's really hard to handle things that are going on. So for work related problems are you okay talking about that today. I think I need to Yeah. So I'd like to do in the beginning, is kind of set a plan for our meeting today, okay. And we can move off that plant if we need to, but I just like to start with that, and give us some structure to what we'll be doing. So, first, and this is something I want to co create with you, right? So your input is extremely valuable to it. I don't want to just lay it out and we follow it. I want you to be an active part of putting this together. So as I throw out some ideas, let me know if it's something that makes sense to you or doesn't. Okay? I'd like to start by having you explain in depth kind of what you're going through at work. I know it's troubling you and I want to hear that story. Then you're going to look for some patterns in the way you're thinking And see if there's something that I recognized all that something I can point out, that may help you a bit. And we'll get more to that later. And then to kind of as we wrap up with towards the end, maybe start getting some ideas of things you can do between sessions between now and we'll see you next time that can help combat these symptoms make you feel better. Okay. Does that seem like a fairly straightforward agenda? Any changes or anything you'd like to make to that? No, I think as long as you think I can tell my whole story in enough time We'll see. Okay. So, you know, you just kind of tell me what's going on as you feel comfortable. And don't worry about the agenda. Okay. Just know that overall, that's kind of what I'm thinking about for the structure. Okay. And then You know, as we as we wrap up, we'll set to make an appointment next time and, and like I said, we'll end up with some ideas, I hope they can help you. So let's get started with kind of, you know, your experience with all this. So tell me about your, your job. Okay, so I, I'm a caseworker, and you know what I do, I usually go into people's homes and, you know, talk to the families, do inspections, that kind of thing. And, you know, I've been doing it for a while now, not too long, but about five years. And overall, I like my job and everything. But just, you know, something happened at work, and it just really kind of, I just feel like, one minute, everything was fine. And now, it just feels like everything's really out of control. So, you know, I was just, you know, doing my normal job making reports and everything like that. And, you know, I made a report about this family that I felt, you know, maybe the children weren't getting quite What they needed, they seemed malnourished The house was really unclean. You know, I suspected that the parents were using drugs there, and it's just really not a good environment. And, you know, turns out that the kids were taken away. And, you know, the family. It just unlike really freaked out, you know, maybe the kids aren't doing well. They're away from their parents, even though it wasn't a great environment. I know that the kids really love their parents, and it's just, it's really, really weighing on me and it's become kind of like a really big issue at work. I guess we're like, everybody knows about it. And, you know, I just feel like I tore this family apart. And I don't know if I made the right decision. And I just, it's like, you know, I used to just, I used to be so confident in what I did. And now I just feel like I'm second guessing everything. This is really stressful. Yeah. So you'd like some make sure I understand. You like your job? But this, this dealing you've had with this particular family. And what happened as a result of that dealing has just really thrown you for a loop. Yeah, it's making me not like my job. Like, I wake up in the morning. And I'm like, I should just pretend I'm sick. I don't want to go, you know, I just feel like, you know, at night, I'm more stressed out, you know, maybe I have an extra glass of wine and I just feel so on edge all the time. So it's really drastically changed the work experience. Yeah. I used to enjoy going to work and you know, feel fulfilled. And now I just feel like, I do not want to go at all. So there's a sense of dread, anxiety. Yeah. Do you feel doubtful? Yeah, definitely, I think anxiety more so but I definitely feel down like, you know, even on the weekends, sometimes I just wake up and I want to stay in bed and you know, I just I feel like I'm having a good time and then I remember what happened and it just brings me back to that place and I've just I don't like it.  It's not not a good feeling",Patient is stressed out at work. Therapist starts ecplaining about the routine as therapist wants patient to be active throughout the process. Therapist explained some techniques. The patient explained the story behind this stress. Patient couldn't go to work because of this one incident even he likes what he is doing.
90,"Summarize: So let's talk about this. So those type of thoughts, like I can't make a mistake or something like that. We call this automatic thoughts. And we'll have plenty of time talk about the different structures in CBT. I do want to explain it to you but over the course of several sessions, let's just take pieces of it for now. Okay. So far we believe is that your beliefs combined with a situation and create these thoughts. So you have this belief, so you're laying in bed for work, and you have this belief that you're maybe not competent. And then the situation that combines with that is, it's time to go to work. So the stress of No, it being time to actually get up and get ready to work. And then you have an automatic thought in that moment. Can right now it's one tied to dread and fear. Let's try to identify an exact one for this example. So let's use that scenario. You believe that you might not be confident you're laying in bed, and the alarm clock goes off. So you're kind of pressured to make a decision about do I get ready for work or not? What's the thought right then? if I go to work I'm going to make a mistake, So if I go, I'm going to make a mistake. And then we talked about your reactions being late. Worry, anxiety. So what we'd like to do when we identify on that felt like that is what's called self talk. And it first this may seem a little odd, right? So you have this thought that comes through it can be an image to the thought image. But it's cognitive in nature. And I can't make a mistake, like, I'm going to make a mistake. I'm going to make a mistake. That's your thought. And the self talk. This is like a rehearsed statement that you literally say to yourself, which again, I get to that seems so odd The first time I do it. So really, you're talking to yourself But over time, we believe if you can keep applying the self talk strategy that you will eventually change the outcome, the reaction and change the underlying belief. Okay? It first though it's going to seem quite foreign to you. Tell me how you how you're processing this now.  So I mean, what am I supposed to say to myself? It's a good question. We'll work on that. And that's what we can do now. Let's take a look at some self talk. So some adaptive responses so they can build. So I'm going to make a mistake. That's the automatic thought that's directly leading. Seems to be to feeling supported dread, and physically not getting work on time. Has there ever been times when you've had that thought? And you went to work on time still?  Yeah. What was different about those times? I guess I told myself, I have to get to work on time because if I don't, it's going to be even worse. If I make a mistake, and I'm late that it just, you know, it compounds and I guess I would tell myself, it's gonna be okay. You just have to get through this day.  Alright, so when you do that, in essence, you are applying self talk. Okay. All right. So that's, that's really the same thing except you probably didn't have a label for it. And when you apply that it seems to work. So the message you're kind of sending yourself now you're telling yourself is I'm going to make a mistake still. But if I'm late for work, I'll be worse. So there's a little bit of positive and negative in here. Right self talk doesn't have to be all positive self talk needs to be, I think when anything realistic and sometimes realistic includes a little negativity. I'd rather focus on the more positive elements as we build this as possible though, so that's pretty good self talk you have now let's work on refining it a little bit to maximize its benefit.",Therapist gave a situation to the patient to understand how is their decision skills. The patient is anxious about making a decision to go or not to go to work.  Patient used to say that patient is going to make a mistake at work. Therapist understand the problem and explains its patients used to say negative about themselves that they are goingto make a mistake. This negative words makes anxious about decision. Therapist suggests a self-talk strategy to improve in reduce anxiousness. Therapist expain how to use a self-talk strategy in patients life.
91,"Summarize: How many times have you gone to work and made a mistake? I don't know. I mean, I guess none technically none that have been something I've gotten trouble for anything like that. Sometimes it's hard to tell because you know, you don't always hear from people afterwards. You can't really tell was it a mistake or not. But I guess none that it had like any major consequences. So none, but there might be a few small ones that you've just never found out about. So Less than a 10th of a percent days you come in probably very small, really, really small. The probability of a statement that you're making being true, is pretty low. The seventh thought rather, I'm going to make a mistake. Probably not supported by the evidence.  Yeah, I guess that's true.  So, the automatic thought is not accurate and not useful. I just got a couple strikes against it. But it is the thought you're having so let's deal with it. I'm going to make a mistake. So what could you tell yourself as the first part of that adaptive response, which acknowledges that fear that's realistic, that acknowledges that fear of making a mistake I guess like it Everybody makes mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes. I could make a mistake today, but it's unlikely that that also be accurate. So everybody makes mistakes. I could make a mistake, but it's probably not gonna happen. Rather than I'm going to make a mistake. So you're going to have that automatic thought either way, likely for a while until you start to apply these adaptive responses. So this is what we're working on is your response. So everybody makes mistakes, I could make a mistake probably not going to happen. And will could be a next part, which is realistic, but also positive. That can help get you past the reaction of being late morning. I'm a good caseworker and I need to do my job so I can help other people and it's going to be okay. Okay, so there's a few few elements in there. It's going to be okay, I need to do my The job I help people all those all those are true So applying as you know even as you say this year with me as you say, it's gonna be okay I need to my shop. What are we actually having right now? I mean it feels a little better but it's hard you know so I felt still feel like it's dangerous I might make a mistake but I guess it helps a little bit Can you see yourself being able to in the moment and I realize this is difficult but in the moment of having that on that thought and that word come in. Can you see yourself applying this self talk? Yeah, I think I probably will because now it will be hard to have those thoughts and not think of you . Okay, I need to calm myself down a little bit. And you've already used self talk on your own before even knew about these? Yeah. It did help in the past. A lot of the corsage to some of the effectiveness of this is based on your ability in that moment to take a step back and follow the training. Right, just like many professionals, professionals depend on their training to help them make the correct intervention correct decision. So think of this kind of like something you've learned in the training. This is a self talk. It's pre packaged, it's ready to go. You can even have it written down. Okay? Doesn't have to be short. It can be like a paragraph, or more if you want as a matter of following the protocol. Once you have the automatic thought, it's easy to descend into worry and fear. You're just looking too quick to grab a moment in there. Apply this treatment strategy. Does that make sense? Sometimes it's likely Well, most of the time, I think you would you would be able to do this. Sometimes you probably won't as important in those moments to not get discouraged. Right. So you can have a self talk for that to write something like Dr. Crowley said it was likely that once a while I wouldn't build do this. it's not gonna work every time. Make sense? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So it's the chaos of life, right in the chaos of emotions that sometimes interfere. the more times you have success, that that seems to be tied with a better chance of improving and reduction of symptoms, but allow yourself failures. Well, it's what I would expect from anybody trying to untangle all these feelings and thoughts. There's not gonna be a perfect connection between that automatic thought and applied self talk. Okay, so be easy on yourself as soon as you can, that makes sense because like, if you could just flip a switch you I would only have to have one therapy session. It'd be good shape, right? so it's a little more difficult than that. But overall, this these strategies are fairly straightforward. And you can definitely learn them and you can definitely do them. I want you to have that confidence. It's, it's normal to have mistakes occur. And to not always do it as you need to as you want to, but in the end, overall, you should be able to be able to apply them and actually It'll get easier in the future to develop your self talk for different thoughts. Okay?",The patient had fear of making mistakes. The patient fear to tell the mistake even he don't that is mistake or not. Therapist told patient about the self doubt the patient had like probability beign true is low in patient. Therapist asks some questions about patient condition while thoughts that he is going to make a mistake. The patient thinks everyone makes mistake. Therapist agreed to the statement but the thing is patient more likely to believe in it and patient thinks its going to be okay. Therapist said there are some elements are okay but still patient feels dangerous if he makes mistake. Therapist asked patient about self talk. Patient practice it to calm himself but doesn't find very helpful. Therapist suggest patient to stepback and follow the training for few days. Therapist told to keep a note not short like a paragraph and read it. Patient thinks its not gonna work everytime but therapist made him understand about this strategy to follow it.
92,"Summarize: So you mentioned before that when you wake up in the morning, you you don't want to go to work, what's going through your mind? I'm gonna have to, you know, hear what my coworkers have to say about what's going on. I might make another mistake. Who knows if I'm going to find out that something terrible happened to these kids when I go back to work? I guess a lot of stuff like that. So looking into one I'm going to make a mistake. That kind of connects to what we were talking about before it says the uncertainty, you're not sure of your own skills and you're afraid of an error that's going to be costly. So when you think that thought, I'm gonna make a mistake, so this is when you're, when you're in bed before you start your day, and you have that thought, what happens right then? I feel more anxious. You know, I think about like, what could happen to somebody else if I make a mistake, like kids going to the wrong home or, you know, not being with their parents when their parents you know, we're not doing anything wrong. And I just feel really like overwhelmed and it gets hard to breathe and I just want to go back to sleep and not have to face anything. So there's emotional consequences. And then the behaviors. You don't want to get out of bed. And then a lot more lately because I have trouble getting out of it. When you're staying in bed, are you under more thoughts coming up? So this is really weighing on you. And he was edified these thoughts that seem to be connected with feelings that are unpleasant, and behaviors are unpleasant, but also maybe not useful. Yeah, they're keeping me from getting the work and stuff like that. So we have a reference point for later on as we continue counseling. I'd like to scale this problem like maybe on a scale of one to 10, where 10 represents feelings that are nearly unbearable, right? And one not really a problem. How do you feel on that scale? Where do you rate yourself right now? Right now in this moment, probably like a five. Around the middle. Yeah, like I'm really stressed out but I not like when I'm in bed, like I can't get out of bed, that kind of thing. How would you rate yourself when you're in bed before you go to work? Probably like an eight. So an eight sometimes nine, right now five, so still not feeling great. Have you had to pick an emotion of standing out above the rest in anxiety, sadness, sense of dread. What would be the worst right now? Right now probably anxiety. So five, on a scale 10 inside is really standing out more",The patient is very anxious about what happened at work. Patient taking stress on consequences if the patient goes to work or not. So the patient is confused between going and not going to work.  Therapist explained the uncertainty of patient's choices and skills. Therapist understands the patient's unpleasant thoughts and feelings while going to bed. Patient  marked 5 on a scale of 10. It shows the Patient is completely uncertain about the work decision. 
93,"Summarize: Hi, Andrea, thanks for coming in.  Hi, Thank you.  So I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here. So I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself. Basically, my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester, and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life. If you decide that you do it's not my job to change you. I couldn't even if I wanted to. That's not my role at all. It's really to help you think about, you know, how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward. That sound okay ? Yeah. All right. So why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself? Sure. Um, As you know, I'm Andrea. I am a junior. I'm in the marching band.  I played a ceter sacks.  Oh  I'm also in the band geek. I play you know, in the Wind Ensemble in the jazz band, things like that. Wow. You really are involved in music. Yeah. When did you start? I started playing about 10 years ago, actually.  Wow. Yeah, I started on the violin first and then I went on explored a little with the piano clarinet. Finally found the center sacks. Yeah, very cool. Y've always wanted to be good at music. Alright, so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun. Um, you know, just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach, things like that.  It's kind of everyday, sort of thing ? Yeah Tell me a little bit about your family. Well, I have one older brother. He's about eight and a half years older than me, my parents and I have a Dog. Cute. What  kind of dog ? It's a golden retriever Oh, nice. big boy. Very funny. All right, and how are things going in school for you?  Pretty good. Grades have been pretty alright. Still like 3.7 ish. Okay, great. So you're doing well? What sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school? I'd like to, you know, I'd like to, of course graduate high school, hopefully go to a nice Ivy League school Ohh Alright.  or I mean, that might not happen. And then I'd like to go on become a doctor, study psychology, you need to come in psychiatrist or something. Okay. You have some pretty big dreams. It's great. It's really exciting to think about that and be looking forward to the future and those things. Yeah. All right. Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life, whether it's, you know, their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies, things like that. Here's the little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community. Again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self determination and spirituality. So when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life? Um, I think a sense of community and belonging. Okay. I think those two and respect, respect. Okay, Yeah, well, I think community and belonging I kind of related them. You know, I said I was in the marching band, I really, you know, I really enjoy being in like that team setting of, you know, being with other people and all working toward together towards that one goal. And then in terms of Respect I, I kind of view that as one of like, my major, like roles, like I really do think respect is important and to respect myself and respect those around me. Okay. I placed great importance to them. Okay, great. So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging, like you said, sort of a sense of purpose.  Yeah. And then the respect is really sort of all encompassing, not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you. yes. Okay, that's great. All right. Well, one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends, so What kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends? Um, sometimes if you just you know, go to the movies go to the beach, like I said, or sometimes we just get together at someone's house, play some board games and hang out. And when you're hanging out with friends, Is there ever alcohol involved. Yeah, sometimes, okay, can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene? Well, it's mostly just for for parties or party settings is kind of to get things going and get everything loosened up, as they say, Mm hmm. And so when you go to parties, most of the time, there's alcohol there. Yeah Okay.  And how often do you think you would say you're drinking? I'd say I'm on a not busy month, for instance, I'd say about like, two weekends out of the month to three.  So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not. Yeah Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink? The days that we drink are mostly like I said, they're parties. So it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun and then when we don't, it's a lot more relaxed. It's a lot more hanging out playing board games, watching the movie. so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohol is there. Yeah, definitely. Okay? And do you notice a big difference? Or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at, say a party versus the night you're playing board games? I think of them as as different. I think, you know, night in playing board games and things, it's meant to be relaxing. So it's nice to have like that kind of breather. Versus with a party. It's a lot more energetic. It's a after at all, it's very draining. Mm hmm. But in the moment, it's quite fun to dance and have fun. Okay, so they're sort of pros and cons.  Yes. Okay. What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol? Um, it's, you know, when we drink, we we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you know, everyone's drinking together. We're a lot more loosened up and relaxed, and not really thinking about stresses or things like that. But it can be when it's too much drinking it can be, can be obviously bad.  Okay. So sort of in the too much drinking or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things are not so good things about alcohol? A lot of times, it'll make make people stupid. Yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things like that we usually try to be as safe about it as possible. So we'll like sleep over a friend's house. And, you know, we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group. So we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks. But um, definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stupid when they're drunk and can be really stupid. Okay So you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities.  Yeah. You're trying to stay put you're not driving or trying to stay with people that you trust. But yeah, it sounds like there's still some some things happening.  Sometimes Yeah. can you tell me a little bit about that? Well, I especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends like we drink too much, and we have like throwing up or things like that. I don't. That's not fun.  Yeah. Throwing up is never fun. Yeah, its not. And how often do you think that happens? For me that's happened to me once. It was the first time I ever drank. And it was, it was a lot. I didn't know what I was doing. I was mixing all kinds of weird things. And just kind of taking anything anyone gave me. That didn't end well. But after that, I haven't, but I do have friends that that still do sometimes. So I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and it kind of puts it down on my on my fun.  Uh huh. Okay, so on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sort of carefree. Let loose a little bit more. On the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess. Planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck. Your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drink too much. Okay, and the other not so good things about the alcohol, people can get a little sloppy, I guess, like they're all loose, like, with people and corners doing things that should be done in private. That kind of stuff. So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things. Yeah, got it.  All right. Well, you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions? I just I you know, have an aunt who is an alcoholic. So I, I see, like the issues that are involved in I've seen movies and things I know that junk drives is an issue. So I, you know, I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like, we can let loose but still be safe, like someone's house or parents at home or something. But so I like I know that there are dangers involved. And I guess I want to limit that and still be able to have fun,  okay. It sounds kind of similar to your, your value of respect to so on the one hand, you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start. If there's too much, then it sort of defeats the purpose. right. And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines. How do you think that the drinking fits in with that ?  in terms of what, in terms of respect? Yes. I think, well, in a way, I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things I'm putting things And then that shouldn't be there. Okay. And then, but in terms of highways, I am respecting myself I am, I'm respecting myself by like, trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking. So I don't get to that blacked out like that calling up and everything and try to, you know, let loose but still be in control of my behavior. So I'm not going to go to some random person I may into I don't know where to do. I don't know what and things like that.  Okay. So you're sort of looking for that balance? Yeah. How much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit, but not crossover. Okay. And what have you come up with at this point? Do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or  ? I usually will I start off by making sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it and how much isn't it so that way I control how much I drink. So I'll usually just, you know, get one of those. cups and then make one drink. And then I'll try to make it last as long as possible. And I'll be like, Alright, this is my one drink, and I'm good. And that way, I still have something in my cup. So people aren't going to be like, oh, here have some more like, No, I'm good. I have mine. And I'll still be, you know, having some to like, let loose a little. And do you feel like that's working pretty well for you? Or do you sometimes exceed that limit? Or, or what do you think ?  for the most part, it works pretty well. Because like I said, people, you know, if people come asking you trying to pressure me, I'll be like, No, I'm good. I have, you know, I still have some, like, I'll get some later and then never end up getting anything. But sometimes they'll be like, hey, let's take a shot and everyone's gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot. And then at that point, I'll be like, Oh, well, maybe I can take one more. And that's when I start, you know, falling into, too much.  So a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time you Maybe you, like you'd like to make some adjustments to make it a little smoother. Okay, so kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself. I'd like to make sure that I, you know, in terms of respecting myself, my body, I'd like to, you know, try to drink less, okay, like a, you know, it is nice to let loose and have fun, but I'd also like it to be so, you know, I'm not damaging my body and I, like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like, 22. And, you know, have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group as a community.  Uh huh.  So kind of combined  goals. Yes Okay. So you're you have a goal. It sounds like actually cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to you to work on that goal on on a scale of one to 10 Where one is not at all important. And 10 is it's the most important thing right now. I'd say about like, like a six or seven. Oh, like to work on it. But, you know, if I get around to it I get around to if I don't I don't. Hmm.  Well, why'd you say six or seven rather than like a four?  Um, because I still think it's, it's important. Uh huh. I still you know, like I said, I don't want my body try especially going to med school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your, your social and your schoolwork and things like that. I know that once I get to college, it's not it's not gonna gonna work out being you know, drinking every weekend and then like, trying to wake up early and go to school, take an exam, like, I know, that's not that's not feasible. It's not a good idea. Yeah, looking ahead. You can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself. Okay. Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to, I think on that same scale from one to 10 I think if I made the decision that I was going to for sure, then I think definitely like a 10 I know I can.  Oh, wow. Okay, why do you say 10?  It's just because I know that once I make the decision, I know I can do it. Uh huh. making the decision in the first place. okay, and so you mentioned, you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. Have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that. Um, I'm thinking of maybe like, trying to convince my friends without sounding you know, dorky or something, be like, Hey, you know, let's just stay in today. Like, let's not go out or something. Or just be like, Hey, I'm not like, I'm not gonna drink today. And then even if my friends do like being okay with them, drinking around, not doing it and then then being okay with me, drinking, me not drinking and then doing whatever they want. So sort of Trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol, and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking. Okay. Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or ? I think so I think it's, it's very feasible. I think it's possible. Okay. So I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities. I'm just making some notes to myself and then maybe reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved. Okay. I think so. That's good. Does that sound like something you'd like to do? Yash Okay. Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school, and You know, becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician, you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there. And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol. And that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body in your health, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much.  Yeah So yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place. And as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again, I'd be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going. Yeah, I like it. Alright, great, so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks.","therapist started conversation by the introduction and also got patient into the conversation by asking about patient's introduction and hobbies, also about family and friends, partying and all.

Yeah So basically, we're here I'm just going to talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all, to judge you or to try and change you, you know, basically, I'm going to talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you. Okay. All right. So I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?  Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old and I'm a senior in high school. Okay.  And What kinds of things do you plan for your life? Well, hopefully go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college. That's great. Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go? Or? I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area I'm looking maybe to apply out of state. Oh,  Cool.  I might go  for college. So kind of keeping your options open. Yeah, definitely. Great. And do you have an idea about what you might want to study? or? Yeah, maybe I'm pre law. Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting.  Yeah. All right, cool. What do you like to do for fun? Well, I'm on the weekends, I like to hang out with my friends. Maybe you go to like a party or go to the mall to shop. Or if there's like a school related event, we'll go to like a football game or something like that.  Ahmmm Yeah. Like to have a good time ? Yeah. And you have a lot of friends or a few close people or?  I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really, really popular or like I have no friends. I'm like normal. That's a good way to be Right. Yeah. All right. So it sounds like in general, your things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now?  They're pretty good A's and B's, so I'm doing okay. Okay, great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So I'm going to show you just a few things on this sheet and if you can look them are so there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self determination, and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you? Um, family, definitely. friendship and belonging. Okay. What's important to you about your family? Well, I, I love them so I want them to think well And I want them to be accepting and love me. Okay. You have brothers or sister ? Yeah, I have one sister. Okay, great. And how about friendship ? friendship. I've grown close to many people that I care about. So I would like them to be accepting of me as well. Great. So being a good friend and having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then what about belonging? You mentioned that one too. Yeah. Just a sense of like fitting in and like getting accepted. Yeah. Not wanting to be part of a group. Yeah, kind of.  Okay, great. All right. Well, one of the things I want to talk about is, you know, you mentioned that you like to go out with friends and party and that sort of thing. And I'm curious when you're at the parties, do you ever have any alcohol? Umm not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most.  Okay, can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene? I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like so it looks like I'm drinking Even though I'm not so maybe people bug me about drinking or something, okay, you're kind of getting pressure from other people who are drinking and it feels easier for you to hold a drink  have one there and pretend you have it. Okay. And do you think that this is most weekends? Or occasionally How often do you think that you are take alchohal one or two weekends a month. The most. No really much So one or two weekends a month, You're in a situation where there is alcohol?  Yeah. Okay. And what sort of situations are you in? Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house. Or even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around. So mainly just kind of hanging out with friends. Pretty much Yeah. Are you ever places where there are parents around or mostly just just with the kids ? mostly just with us, but sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to your family as well. So Well just hang out.  And what about driving? Like drunk driving? Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had alcohol?  Definitely, No, I've never drunk driven. And I've never been in a car with a drunk driver. So that's something that you sort of made a decision about. Because I know that's extremely dangerous. Okay, what do you know about how that's dangerous?  Well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like, crashes and accidents and things like that. So I rather not be in that situation.  So you're really trying to be safe and make sure that you're not putting yourself into situations. Yeah That's great. You know, it's it's tough to do sometimes. And I really commend you for being able to stick with that.  Yeah. So you mentioned you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two, what do you think's the most alcohol you've ever had in one day? No more than two drinks. Okay. So the absolute most Yeah, those two. Okay, and what kinds of things do you like about alcohol? Um, I've never really been drunk. So I can't really say that I like that feeling or not. But it's just I mean, you're just in a good mood.  Mm hmm.  So it just kind of makes you feel relaxed. Yeah relax Okay. Anything else?  Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much. So I wouldn't be able to tell you.  Okay. And I mean, not so good things about alcohol?  Um, definitely. Yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff, and it's getting a little later, some people that drink like drank too much, they start throwing up or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious. And that's not fun for anybody. So you've seen a lot of other kids Yeah, had some consequences and decided that's not for you. Yeah,  I got it. I can understand that. Any other things that you can think of?  No, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody. It's gotten to like a serious accident. And so it's just very like obnoxious thing. Okay, well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is underage drinking is something that's not legal, and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So I'm wondering what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life? Um, I know, it's definitely risky. I mean, I guess we still do it. So it's kind of something that it's just there. Yeah It's just there. Okay. And I'm curious, you mentioned you know, your friends are important to you and your family's important in sort of fitting in is important to you, and how does alcohol play a role with that?  Um, well, definitely not in my family life because my parents don't really condone, okay, alcohol use. But friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved.  Okay.  So from your family perspective, that Drinking is not something that fits very well.  Yeah. And with friends, you feel like it's easier to to hang out with alcohol. Or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun or your friends wouldn't like you as much. I guess it means this is just there. Okay so it ties in with the whole belonging. Well, when you think about your drinking and sort of looking forward five years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life? It probably will have a very small role, if any, in my life considering I have big plans for my future.  Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean? I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school or in college or trying to get off school, things like that. Okay, so the alcohol, something that might make it harder to reach your goals?  Yeah, definitely. So when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say when you get to college ? maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway. So maybe like one drink every once in a blue moon.  Okay, so you sort of have a plan to cut back on your drinking eventually. Yeah definately how might that go? Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school. And once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything bigger. Yeah. So you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments? Yeah, definately that's a good thing. Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all important, not something you're thinking about. And 10 is the most important thing,  maybe five or six. And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three? Because it's not something I do not care about it all but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself. Okay. So It is something you have thought about. Yeah. And how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale? I'm pretty confident that I can, considering that I'm not really an alcohol user, per se. I'm not really into that whole scene, so it's gonna be difficult for me. So what number do you think you'd say? On a scale of one to 10, If I can quit alchohol? Yeah maybe like an eight or nine. Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind. It sounds like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments and you're drinking at some point. Yes.  And it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself. And you actually feel very confident that you could be successful. With it, what sort of gold Do you think might be good to set for today? Um, probably to stop. Maybe next Friday I go to I have a drink at all.  Okay. Do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely? Yeah, I mean, I can just tell my friends, my parent, my friends aren't really that pressuring. It's just like outside people that don't really know that well. So I could just tell them, Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today. But what might be some benefits of following through with that goal? Definitely, I'll have like, all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on. Uh huh. Anything else?  Um, health concerns? I guess I know, alcohol is bad for your health. So that would be one. Okay. So it's, it sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore, at least at the next party and seeing how it goes. Yeah. Okay. Do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if working out for you. Yeah, that would be okay. All right, great. And then it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are health benefits and having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do. Right. Okay. Well, very good. Is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know?  How would you advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking? Oh, that's a great question. So a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back it's harder if their friends are still drinking. And one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol. But of course, that's harder if you're not doing planning. So some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends. Some of the things that I would recommend, since you're interested Are you know, carrying around Different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say without any alcohol mixed into it. Often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something. It kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you?  Yeah, for sure. Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it? Have you thought about how you might approach with them? Or is that something else you'd like some tips about about telling them about your plan to stop drinking? I was just planning on playing them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That was me. Know,  your friends would be pretty comfortable with that. Yeah, I mean, that was my closest friends for sure.  Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else? I go?  No, I think okay.  Okay. So then, like I said, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going. And then if things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks and we can maybe problem solve together.  Okay. Is that  Okay ? Yeah. All right. Thanks so much. No problem","The conversation started with an introduction of the therapist and patient. The therapist asks about the patient's school, college, hobbies, and all. The patient used to drink sometimes and was also pressured by friends to drink alcohol. The patient is under age to drink alcohol, but the patient used to do it for friends. The patient has big plans in life but alcohol making it hard to reach the goals. Patient wants to cut down on alcohol when he goes to college. Patient is confident about quitting alcohol. Patient was concerned about his friends as well. Therapist gave some tips to stop their friends from drinking."
95,"Summarize: Hey Lewis How you doing today? I am okay, how are you?  I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. How things been going ? They've been alright. Last time we were talking. It sounds like you're still having some difficulty with the quizzes. Mm hmm. Is that still the case? Yeah, it's still. It's still panic when I take them. They're still panic.  Can you tell me about the process of taking the quizzes? I know we tested on a little bit before. Okay. So I'm going to class I'm fine. I sit down to take the test. I'm fine. The test is in front of me question one. I'm not going to get that answer. So you're looking down so you take these quizzes in class? Yes. like a paper pencil ? Hmm hmm  Okay, with other students around you. Yeah. Alright, is the is having other students around distracting you ? No, what has happened in previous online classes is the same. So it's, you're pretty sure it's the quiz itself and not some external. Hmm yeah. Okay. So it was paper and pencil you seated in the room. Rooms relatively distraction free. Yeah, yeah, everybody's quiet. And you're looking down at really the first item on the on the quiz and what's happening? What's happening that as you look down, you read that first item. What's happening at a thought we'll start a thought level What's happening? What are you thinking? I'm thinking, I'm reading the question and I'm thinking oh my god, there's Okay, there's four. Okay? So it's got to be it's got to be one of them. And I am not going to pick the right one. I'm gonna think I pick the right one and it's going to be the one that the second choices and I am not going to pick the right one. Okay, so your thought is that you're going Gonna get, you're gonna select the wrong response, and therefore get that quiz item. Wrong.  Yeah. How about behavior? Like, do you notice anything physically going on? As you're thinking about that quiz item and how you're going to get you call to my palms are probably sweaty, like I'm probably a little tense. a little tense ? Yeah. That's really is. So it could be is that this thought of, I'm going to get this item wrong is leading to these uncomfortable feelings, the physical feelings. All right. So what happens when you answer item one, like you don't know if you have a right or wrong immediately, right because it's a paper and pencil. So you answer item one and you move on to item two. What happens then? starts all over again. I'm already like well, I already got the first one wrong and now my I chances are higher getting this one wrong. So if you like it, because you because you thought that you got the first one wrong. That's your chances again a cycle on one wrong actually increase. Yeah. Okay. If I get one to one wrong the whole test gonna to be wrong. Have you ever had a quiz that you've taken where you were confident that you got the first item right? I'm sure I have I can't remember any. But eventually you're going to come to one item that your doubts about ? Yes, right. Inevitably it happens. There's gonna be one that's maybe a little more difficult or difficult for you. So it seems like what you're saying is that when you reach that item where you have that thought, from from that point on the next item is, is more difficult because you're having a similar thought Does that pattern continue?  throughout test? Yes. So explain to me what like, let's just go with the example, the first item like, because just just to keep it more simple. So you have the first item. And that didn't work out for that thought, right? The second one your thought was, I have even greater chance of missing. So what happens after you respond to that second item? It just compounds, I just start I feel worse than worse as the quiz as I continue. That's awful. So it's an awful feeling for me. Yeah right. So by the time you get to item five or six ? I'm convinced I'm, it's over. I've gotten to zero if it's Yeah, if isn't the first I've gotten to zero I've gotten a bad grade. Right. So that's what's on your mind. Uhh hmmm mm And how are those physical symptoms? Are they the same different or new symptoms ? if it like if it's, if it like starts early at the beginning of the test? To my heart's like pounding at this point, but I still have a sweaty palms. I'm still like, tensing.  So it really just gets mentally and physically more unpleasant for you. Mm hmm. Yeah. So when you just when you're saying panic, the panics really occurring a few items in after you have the first one that you thought you've missed. Mm hmm. And this has been happening for a while, as you described, right? Yeah. Well, how about your grades? How have you actually been doing on the quizzes? I've been a pretty solid B student. Umm hmm. So and I feel I wish I did better. I wish I got A's but I mean, these are fine. But when I take this because it's not it doesn't. I don't know how it translates. About your study habits if you consider yourself effective and studying ? I've tried I've taken workshops on studying I've, I, I think I'm pretty effective at studying I've found what doesn't work. So, I try to study by reading the chapter is taking outlines reviewing flashcards, which has, I think the best results but Okay, so your study habits are good. And your quiz scores are good. But you're still having these distressing thoughts and these uncomfortable physical sensations when you take the quizzes?  Yeah. Is that about right? Yeah, that's absolutely right. So really, you don't necessarily need your performance to change. You just you just need to your thoughts and feelings and behaviors to change. Yeah. So how you how you're reacting to the quizzes maybe. Yeah, cuz I get B's like I said so Yeah. And B is good. Yeah. So Alright, so I want to take you back to the moment when you're looking at the first slide. Let's go back to that for a second. Okay. So you're taking a quiz. And you're having those thoughts surrounding the first item, which will not mistaken the automatic thought we talked about this right with cognitive behavioral therapy. Go on Mac thought is that I'm, I'm not going to get this one right. Yeah or something to that effect ? right. What does that mean to you? It means once I don't get that, right, I'm not Getting in anything else, right, okay Alright So with that thought means to you is that you're going to miss that item and then you're going to miss all the rest of it. So you're, you're going to fail the whole quick whole thing.  Yeah. So looking at that, almost, let's call that an intermediate belief, right? It's more of a rule or an expectation, right? What does that mean to you? It just gets worse. If I fail the quiz, then I'm like, Oh my god, I'm gonna fail the panel, I am going to fail the course and that's gonna affect my GPA. So just keep stacking other other beliefs. So you're gonna fail the course. And we're gonna fail the final rather than then the course. So a few failed the course. What does that mean to you ? not going to graduate. You're not going to graduate ? Yeah. So we've moved from failing the quiz if we just look at the meaning, right? To fail on the final to fail on the course, and now to not graduating. So if you didn't graduate, what would that mean to you? I can't I can't be a teacher. I can't do what I want to do. So your chosen location to be a teacher would be not possible. Right. Right. So we go a step further and say, What would it mean to you if you couldn't be a teacher? I don't know who I'd be at that point. That's what I always saw as my career. So I don't know what my future would look like at that point. Without that. So if you were to phrase it, and kind of think back as we to the CBT techniques and the kind of conceptualization uncovered. If you're to phrase as an if statement. What would you? What would you be if you couldn't be a teacher? what that make you? I am a person who didn't make it. I'm a person that failed. Like we said earlier. I'm a person who didn't make it. I'm a person who failed. So in a way, you're saying, I'm a failure.  Hmm. Right. Yeah. Is that close? Yeah, Its fine.  So remember, we talked before about core beliefs, and how these core beliefs drive these intermediate beliefs which combined with situations like in your case, taking quizzes to form these automatic thoughts.  Yeah. so one of your core beliefs may be that, that you're a failure. You may believe that. Okay Does that seem like something that you've said to yourself before or thought before? And think about it like that until we did the step up to it now, but I, I can relate to that. Mmm hmm Because a lot of times, I do feel like, Oh, I'm not gonna be able to do this. Because it's me, I won't be able to do it. Not because it's challenging or difficult, but something to do with you.  Hmm yeeah. Right. So that's what I call like the you're personalizing ? Right So you're saying to yourself, at a variety of levels. I'm going to be unsuccessful? I'm going to....doe that make sense.  Yeah. Do you think that's what's happening? It must be because like I said, I study I got good grades. I've been tested years ago, I don't have ADHD anything intrinsic that would prohibit me So you're  able to focus and calm. Yeah, well,  yes, I can do all of that. But when it comes to it, I'm like, I can't do it. So, somewhere, somewhere is this dis core belief? And it's possible that it has something to do with you believing that you are a failure. unsuccessful?  I don't think they would see the connection. I think it would be like, well, you do well in school, I don't understand. So they wouldn't believe that you're a failure ? No you may believe it ? Yeah. I guess, Yeah. And similarly, if you had a classmate that was in the same situation, and and you know, struggled with these disturbing thoughts and feelings and behaviors during quizzes, how would you evaluate them? I guess I'd say the same thing that my family would say like you're gonna look at the evidence, you're not a failure. And you evaluate that they weren't a failure. Right. But If it was  yourself. You're being a little more harsh. Yeah. Which isn't uncommon. Okay  So, there's a few levels at which I think we can go after this. What I'll call a problem, but really, it's a series of thoughts and beliefs. Okay. The first is that the comic at the ground level, and that's when you are taking the quiz. And you have that automatic thought that says, I'm going to miss this item.  I'm not going to get it right. Yes, I'm not gonna get it right. So that's your thought, I'm not going to get it right. Ahmm hmm And these situations, I like to encourage clients to apply what's called an adaptive response or self talk. So it's a it's a noun. If you're in a quiz in a quiet classroom, it wouldn't literally be self taught.  Right, right. But it's a thought that you were consciously applying. So the other thought that's automatic, Right that just pops in your head, right.  Okay. This one would be one that you deliberately think and make myself. So what could you think to yourself that would be a counter to that automatic thought that you're having, that you're gonna get that item wrong ? I guess that in my past quizzes like, chances are I, I have a good chance of getting it right. Okay, so just looking at the probabilities based on your past performance, even though I'm thinking I'm going to get it wrong right. Chances are, I'm going to get it wrong, right. Somehow I still have a B so. So you are getting most of them. Right. Right. So I have a good chance. So I like that adaptive response. Right. Do you think that makes sense for you? Yeah I think you did well, there. So the next time you're taking a quiz I want you to apply that adaptiv response. Okay that this takes work. Right. So this automatic thoughts gonna come upon you. And then before you know it, you're gonna have that feeling.  Yeah, right.  physical symptoms. Yeah. Discuss the sweaty palms. Right. And the feeling of I think you mentioned Yeah, yeah. So don't let it discourage you those symptoms Come on so quickly. Okay. Right. There is an intervening thought and you've identified it. Right. So, you will have an opportunity, most likely to apply that automatic thought at some point. But the first few times it might be a little rough.  Yeah, testing QA.  I guess the nice thing about a quiz is, I mean, how many items are on these quizzes?   15 So you have a few different chances to apply the adaptive responses. Right, right. It's more than one. Yeah. So you know, you'd like to get on the first time where you have that on I thought we identified on that thought, but if you don't No big deal. Right? So, you know, later on maybe it takes them two or three. And then you might remember, hey, I have this Yeah. Oh, wait, supposed to be thinking that. Yeah. And my hope is that as you apply this adaptive response more and more, you can reduce the probability that that automatic thoughts going to come in.  Yeah So that's one level that I want you to, to go after it. Does that make sense? It does. I think I can do that. That's how many feel like you could you could do at the other level, I guess you'd call this a deeper level, but it's all really, you know, in your brain, right? It's just this core belief. right. Okay. And why use the word deeper is because we think of core beliefs as more stubborn, but they don't change as easily. right as automatic thoughts might. I'd like you to and this is really just more selection, reflect on the evidence or evaluate the evidence that supports and refutes this idea that you were unsuccessful that you're a failure.  Okay Right. I think cognitively, you kind of understand that you're not. Right. But another sense, you feel like you are right.  Right. So in a way cognitively you're there's that discrepancy. Right. Right. There's, there's a little bit of both.  Mm hmm. Yeah,  you can tell me that, your family would say that's not the case. But you still right on paper, Technically, I would. I'm not. But I still, I guess, feel that way. There's a part of you that still feels that way. There's a part of you that still believes that cognitively. There's also a part of you that thinks through that says that's that's not accurate. Right. So I want you to weigh the validity of that core belief. Okay Right. And actually, I think that this is helpful to write down evidence that that would support it. Right. And that's certainly something to note. But also, and this is really more important evidence that refutes it. evidence that runs counter,  right,  but record both, and we'll meet next time and we'll look at the evidence evaluated. Yeah, we can do that. So those two, those two steps you feel like you're comfortable with and they make sense to you. Yeah, they do. Yeah, I definitely think I can do those.  When's the next time you'll be taking a quiz? Think next week next week? yeah Okay, I know how these quizzes oftehn?  Yeah. All right. So we'll set up a session for next week. Let's try to get towards after your next quiz. Okay So we'll have that to talk about. I think that's the next area to make. It sounds like the next area. It'd be good to try and make progress. Yeah. Seems like that's what you want to work on. Yeah. So We'll go from there. So I'll set up an appointment for just to have that quiz. Tried to adapt the response and try evaluating evidence. Quickly. Yes,  does that sound good ? Yes, I can do that.  All right. I will set the appointment up and I appreciate you coming in and working through this. Yeah. Thank you so much.","Patient had some difficulties with quizzes. Patient gets panic. Patient is fine until the test start suddenly don't get the answers.

99,"Summarize: Hi Ann, how are you doing today ? I am Okay, how are you Dr. Grande? I am good, thanks for asking what's been going on? Not really a lot of change on the drug front. Mm hmm it's as you know, the the  Adderall I'm really struggling. still struggling with the Adderall?. Yeah. I'm not sure what to do because I know that I mean, I'm having such a hard time with it. But when I don't have it, I am. I'm just not functioning I'm not able to get As much accomplished right, so, go ahead well it's it's like it's always there to. It's always available ? it's always available, Yeah. Or so much at the time. You're having some mixed feelings about it. So I'm sensing. Yeah. Yeah. Like I know I want to stop you think you think you want to stop? Yeah. No, I do.  You do ? Oh my god see, I feel crazy, but I know it would be good if I didn't have it in my life. But at the same time it is in your life ? And I don't know how to get out of that. I mean, the one thing if I didn't live with my roommate, that would be one thing. Like, it wouldn't be in the apartment all the time. So you find you have easier access to the Adderall when you're when you're in the house or apartment with your, with your roommate.  Yeah. So if you physically weren't there, like with your roommate in that apartment? Yeah, like if I was oh my god living at home with my parents again or even living with somebody else, I guess. Oh my god, move ? What a hassle but that's I mean, that's the problem. It's just there. It's it's accessible. So you're kind of it sounds like you're recognizing that, maybe you don't have the willpower to stop taking the drug when it's right there in front of you. Maybe you're right. Yeah, that's that's good. Because before I didn't really want to stop at some, I mean, I definitely sometimes I want to stop, I'm my mind, I'll go back and forth. You know, but for the most part I would like to be without it. You know, I really don't want to deal with this anymore. So mostly so so there's still some feelings for you. You want to use it, but mostly you would like to stop ? Well, it makes us so easy to get stuff done. I mean, I just take a couple and boom boom boom, I mean, so there's some advantages for you ? Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And I'm so used to it. So it's just comfortable and it's comfortable and it allows you To be productive. Are there any downsides to it? Well, yeah. When I don't have it, the crash, it's like a really bad crash and I'm not productive. You know, it's it's, and it's gotten worse than it used to be.Like I need it. So it's painful ? It's painful. Definitely. Definitely. It feels like a trap. I want out. And one of the ideas you're having was sound like potentially was moving out, moving out of the apartment, because then you wouldn't have access to the who would have access to the Adderall anymore? Or it would be hard to get ? Oh my god, like sometimes it's really weird. Sometimes it feels like that's a good idea. And then sometimes I'm like, No, no, I don't want to be You know kind of cut off from it but I think I am come ready.  You think you're ready for that? Yeah And that moving out you really see is what you would need to do. Because stopping while living there is too difficult. Yeah, yep, I think you're right. Remember before you've tried to stop living there a few times right or, or last few months and with your roommate having it with your roommate being the one that gives it to you. It just appears that temptation so great for you. Yeah, she really doesn't get it. She doesn't understand like, What? What a problem this is for me? She's definitely not supporting me or anything like that. Yeah, God, maybe it would be better Well, are there any disadvantages to living with your parents? living with my parents at my age, it just feels like a little bit humiliating a lot humiliating.  Okay, so humiliation would be one. Yeah, just this feeling of failure, embarrassment and then my mom just is in my business. So some clear disadvantages to move into Paris any advantages other than the obvious who would separate you from the  Adderall? Am I would you buy laundry? fully stocked fridge? Yeah. Yeah, my dad will fill my gas tank up. things that happened before ? Uh huh. So there's some disadvantages to this plan, but there's some advantages. And there's a key advantage of being think of narrow. Yeah. And it wouldn't necessarily have to be the rest of my life either. Just for now, just to get me out of that apartment with the Drug. Right ? That would separate you from the drug and you could potentially move out later on. Oh my god, do I want to I mean, that that's just it. Like, it's like, it sounds really good until I like really think about it. When you really think about it, what comes to mind? Oh, like I start to shake like that feeling of, you know, when you really want something, you really want something and you can't get to it. And that desperation that I'm like, right now, I know that, you know, I'm living there, it could be my choice. I could take it, or I could not take it. You know, but at least when I want it, it's there. If I move out, I'm like making that decision for myself.  That's right. It would be. I don't know. Is it tough? Yeah Before it seemed like you're really more on the side of making this change than not. Clearly, there's still some things you want to consider. No, you know, you're right, though. I want out, and it's not really a choice when I'm there. Like I say, I have the choice yes or no, but the choice is always Yes.  You always end up using the Adderall ? Yeah. So, so make sure I understand the situation overall. You live with your roommate, she has that role and she makes it available to, you use it? Yeah You've tried to stop that behavior, but that's just not working for you. Yeah, yeah, that's so clear. And I don't want to be using it. You don't want to be using it. But yet you are. Especially because the proximity, right, like cuz you're right there and she has it and it's just tougher to stop that behavior. There's another possible decision, which is moving back home, which has some disadvantages and advantages.  Yeah, that's true. It would be nice having that fully stocked fridge. so that there's an upside to it. Yeah That would be beyond just not using the drug which would which fit itself It'd be a big victory for you. Yeah. And my mom would be there to talk to Yeah. Yeah. So let's do this. It seems like that's the direction you're moving. Right? Okay. No pun intended with moving. But that's, you're you, you're thinking that might be a better way to go? Yeah. So, for the next session, let's plan out that and this wouldn't necessarily be doing anything. This would just be let's plan out the steps that you'd have to put in place to move out to move back home, talking to your parents, whatever financial arrangement, have the roommate, getting all your stuff out the logistics of moving, let's just go through the steps.  Okay. And try to get a firm plan together. And of course, you can always re evaluate and change your mind.  Okay, right.  But all we're doing at this point, is just just planning and seeing how it would look.  This is kind of exciting. Exciting ? Yeah, it definitely is. I can do that. So I will see you and next week ? okay and we'll pick up where we left off and we'll, we'll start with a planning and we'll see what happens with that.  Cool. All right. Thanks.","Patient couldn't leave drug and struggling to leave it. Patient can't work well without drugs. Drug is always available for patient.  Patient wants to stop but can't leave when it's available. adderall is easily accessible to the patient at house or at apartment with roommate.Therapist saw a change in patient that patient is thinking to stop but doesnt have the willpower to stop. The patient had some advantages of doing drugs like feels comfortable and makes productive. Disdvantage is can't be productive and painful if not consumed. Therapist suggested to move out from the apartment so that patient couldn't access it. Therapist understand that moving out for patient is difficult but its important to stop doing it. Patients feels humiliated at this age to live with parents. Patient had some advantage to live in paris like buying laundry, fully stocked friend etc.Therapist says that it would be helpful to get rid of adderall.

100,"Summarize: Hi Ann, how are you doing today ? Hi Dr. Grande, about the same. About the same ? Yeah what was going on ? Well, it might be a little worse had you know, I've been talking about my problems with the perks. The past couple of times I've seen you and I don't know I think at work, they might be starting to notice a little bit. They might be starting to notice that you're under the influence of the Percocet? Yeah. Could before I remember when we talked, it seemed like you felt safe in that No one was gonna find you out. Well, yeah, because when I take them, I feel normal. Like, it makes me feel like I can function. And I feel normal. But like, definitely last week, my coworker in the cubicle across the way was she was looking at me, she was just looking at me really funny and, and then also, I've been having a little bit of trouble with the numbers. I'm just not. I'm not on my game the way I used to be. And I know that there is a connection to the drugs. So in terms of concentrating, focusing? yeah, yeah, definitely. It's hard to focus but if I don't do it I don't know. I mean, I can barely get out of bed. I can I don't know, I'm completely what to do  And this is tough for you. The Percocet makes you feel normal. I would talk about this before. Yeah, it used to give you high, but not anymore. No, right. It is not fun. But it makes you feel normal. Right. And we've talked about the detox options. Oh god no.no no no,  it's not something that you want. So really, what's changed to make things more difficult is that you're worried that your coworkers are on to you. Right. And it's your performance in terms of focusing on on your accounting work has been compromised as well.  Yeah is that right ? Yeah. And when you put it that way, she's definitely noticed it and she talks to so it's not like she's if she thinks something's up. With me, she's going to keep it to herself. So that would be the reputation piece and then also, the quality of my work. I know it's, it's not the same, it's a lot harder for me to produce what I used to. And you're afraid that's going to be noticed as well? Yeah, for sure. But I can't take detox, there's it's just not an option. Alright. Let's talk about I want to do some scaling work. I want to talk about the importance of this change to you know, cuz we've been talking about this change for a while that change, like giving up the Percocet.  Yeah. Let's talk about, let's just talk about the importance of it though. So just focus on that one narrow piece. Okay, we're just we're just talking about how important it is. So on a scale of one to 10, with one being not important at all, and 10 being extremely important. How important is it to you that you that you can make this change? Can you make this change? See, I go back and forth. I don't know that it's that important. Well, if I lose my job, that would be horrible. So maybe it is pretty important. I mean, it's important that I keep my job. It's really important that I keep my job, and then it keeps my reputation. Well, so it's important that you keep your job and that importance, in a sense now appears to be tied to the importance of not using Percocet. They've been tied together a little bit, right. Yeah, because to get out of bed, yeah. Okay. So if you if you if you had to pick a number one to 10, or 10 is extremely important. How important is it to you to make the change? 7     8     7. 7 so fairly important. Alright, eight. I mean, I got to keep it up. You have to keep it up? Yeah. So let's talk about another construct. That's important. Okay. I want to talk about confidence. So using that same scale, how confident are you that you can beat the Percocet? That's what I've been trying to do for how long have I been coming in here? About about six months now. I've tried I mean, I have really tried. I know I can't I don't I don't. I don't think I can do it. So it was in the one to 10 scale. What do you think you would be? Like 0   1 I can't. I've been trying. So very low confidence, nope really no confidence. You have no confidence. You have no confidence that you can change and it's very important to you that you do change. So this is a real bind the trend.  Yeah, it's pretty depressing. You mentioned that one of the reasons your confidence is low is because you tried over the last six months and working with me and you've not been successful at stopping the Percocet use. I'll leave here swearing to myself. I'm done. You know that next week I'm going to come in and I'm going to tell you that I didn't use at all and then like before, I'm in bed. I've already taken some you know that night. So it's easy to see where the low confidence rating comes in. Based on your experiences the last six months. How about other times when you've been able to make a tough change? If you look through your, your past and different experiences, has there been any other occasions where you have been successful, beating something like this and making a tough change? Well, yeah, I mean, I used to I used to with the gambling I guess, I I used to hit Delaware Park, you know, on a regular basis and spent a lot of money and my husband was pretty upset about it and I had a really hard time stopping that.  So that was those tough that was. Would you say that you felt addicted to gambling? We Oh yeah, definitely. And it was painful to stop. Are you happy that you did stop? Oh, God, I would never want to go back to that. Yeah. So when you were in the middle of that addiction of gambling, right, how likely to seem that you would be able to stop back then? Yeah, that's that's a really good point. I didn't think that I was going to be able to say probably about a to two or three.  So there's some parallels here between what happened with the gambling and with what's happening now the Percocet. I didn't think about it that way. So I really didn't think I could do it then and it's been, you know, a couple years since I've even been in a casino. So you would say you were successful at beating that addiction? Yeah, definitely. Definitely success, so what happened?  It's so different. It's different. It's so different. Oh my god. Let's talk about that. Just like I just find myself popping them in my mouth. You know. So the mechanism is different. Like for the gambling, you'd have to drive to the casino to drive Delaware Park.  Right You'd have to have money Right, Right.  Whereas the the percocets so easy. Yeah that you get them for my friends. Yeah. And it's a lot easier to consume and Percocet than to get in your car and make the time and so the mechanism is different. Okay But wonder if there's any similarities with this? Well, with the success and the potential success, meaning you you thought that you could never stop gambling, you think that you could never get through detox? I didn't think about detox, but you're right. It was miserable in that period when I first stopped kind of casino and I felt that really strong urge to go. And I made it through that, my husband was amazing. You husband was supportive? Oh yeah, he was really great. He would sit with me he would talk me through it. We go to movies sweet, you now he was really encouraging. Probably be really happy to see me stop using these Percocet too. So as you reflect on your confidence, and this is not something you necessarily need to do right now. It's probably important to consider that you were successful before in the past. All the circumstances were different.  Okay. But you gained too high from that gambling. Yeah. that was it was addictive? Right and and you beat it and it and it was hard it was challenging but you also have a supportive husband. Would you have your support your husband if you tried to stop Percocet? Oh, yeah. Yeah. He He's really, you know, upset, by the way, and I'm taking them and he's really worried about me losing the job. I don't see why he wouldn't be able to help me in the same way, I guess. Well, since this since stopping is important to you, but your confidence is low. But this might be a good area to kind of process which is, you know, you do have the supports in place, and you have successfully defeated addiction before. So it's something to consider, as you weigh, you know, I know that detox is something you've expressed really clearly that you're not a big fan of and I can appreciate your reasons. At the same time, get support, you don't lose your job. So, let's do this. Let's, between now and when I see you next, maybe reflect on some of the strengths and supports and the past successes you've had.  Okay And see if we can accurately factor those into this equation.

101,"Summarize: Hi Amy, I'm Denise I one of the advocates here, at the center and how are you? How are you today? I'm fine. Thanks. Well, strange feeling strange for this, but okay. Yeah, it's something really different for you. Umm hmm I have I've not done this before. Well, why don't you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today? I'm not even sure I am I heard about this place and that you work with women who are having trouble with a relationship and are confused. And so I thought I'd give you guys a call. And so I'm, thank you so much for taking the time to see me. So you're, you've heard a little bit about the program here. Would it help if I just explained a little bit about what what my role might be today? Yeah, yeah, cuz I don't know what to do. What I want to reassure you of is that I'm not here to try and tell you anything that you might need to do or to try and give you advice or information at all. I'm here to help you in whatever way is useful to you to sort out what what's going on and what if anything you'd like to do differently. So this is really up to you. What you would like to explore today, how does that sound? That sounds really hard because I'm not sure I'm very good at sorting things out myself. Yeah. Yeah. So right now you're feeling a little overwhelmed with everything that's going on, and you're not even sure where to start. Yeah, that's a good way to put it. I'm kind of confused about what to do next. And I have a little baby at home, so I don't I can't think anyway, most the time. Yeah. So now anything any kind of decisions you make, or anything that you do affects both you and and the baby.  Mm hmm. And, and my boyfriend affects him. Which is why I guess I guess I'm here to talk about him and me and the baby and what we're, you know, how we work together. Well, I if you're interested or you're willing, why don't you tell me a little bit about your story? I don't know where to start. He and I had been together for about a year. And I got pregnant right away and we just had this baby a little while ago. And and before that I was working. And he and I, you know, we're on and off here and there, we get invites and he disappears for a while then he comes back. That's kind of what the ears look like. And I just been getting more and more confused on what to do and recently he did something really that didn't even look like him. He looked like a different person and it freaked me out and freaked the baby out. And quite honestly, it freaked him out too. He didn't he said he didn't know what happened and he felt he said he felt out of control. So the in the history of the relationship over this year, it's kind of been in and out in a way and there have been Some incidents where you've had some arguments and then separated for a while and gotten back together but it does sound like something pretty significant happened that sort of freaked everybody out. All all of you the baby and you and him and, and was kind of scary.  Mm hmm. Yeah, he came home. I was a friend come over a man friend, he doesn't like me to have men friends came over to help me with my resume, because I'm starting to think about going back to work. And he had a weird look in his eye and so I kind of, you know, we sped up and I kind of let my friend leave but soon as after right after he left he he kind of just got this dark, scary look and he pushed me onto the ground and and it was just different than anything that ever happened to me or us together and He just got this weird kind of like he was possessed by something. And he said he didn't, he would never do that again. He's he's really good daddy. And he really helps us out a lot. So in a way it doesn't, it didn't even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand, He's really good. Good with you and good with the Father. I mean, good with your child. And on the other hand, it was just like, what is this something really different? Yeah. Yeah. And he's, he's, he really helps us out. And I didn't know what to do with that. So that's why it's, I guess that feeling that I have had since that happened has prompted me to call somebody to figure out what to do. What are your thoughts right now about some of the options out there for you to do if, if anything, what are what are you thinking about?  I haven't talked anybody for for a year really gotten pretty isolated ? Yeah. Yeah, I haven't my parents live pretty far away and, and I guess he's kind of a boyfriend kind ofI guess the words jealous. He just really cares about us. And so I haven't had a chance to really talk to people about what some ideas would be that will. What could I do, I used to work and I was kind of looking forward to working again. He's he's sort of made it clear that I don't need to work because he's going to take care of us he brings home diapers and gives us some money when he's around and so we really don't need it most the time. So you had been kind of thinking about maybe going back to work and doing doing some of that on your on your own and, and yet He, he doesn't really he's expressing that he liked to be able to take care of you. And, and when he's there, he does take care of you.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it does take care of us. He's, uh, he's he makes sure that I have enough money for, you know, the basic needs in the house and he pays the rent and, and you know, but when I when he's gone and I run out of money, it just kind of that's when I think cut it. Just wish I could take a little bit by myself. I just not sure how to go about doing that. Does that leaves you in a real bind when you're, you're there and you don't have what you need? And I yeah, and I don't know who to talk to about that. I try to call him sometimes and make up you know, and say sorry for the fight that we had and sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't. So you've kind of find yourself when you're in that bind, trying to find ways of, of getting getting what you need. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know how to do this. I mean, I don't know what to do next. Not very good at it. I just want to say we can go over some things that are potential to talk about to really focus on that might help you. But I just want to let you know that this is, I really appreciate how hard this is to be able to talk about it. And it's it's not an easy situation, and you're definitely not alone. And I really appreciate your willingness to talk about it. Thanks. It's really hard to Yeah I know. There are lots of different things that we can talk about that are that that many women in very similar situations find themselves and things that we can talk about and focus our conversation on that might help you just sort of sort out and Figure out what if anything that you want to do differently or how to what your next step might be? okay And and some of those that we work with are like talking about the relationship, you've mentioned a few things about your, your relationship and how it kind of goes in and out and it's can be really good and, and then he can be gone for a while and just sort of sorting some of that out about where you are with that. We can certainly talk about resources about the resources in the community that may be there for you, or in terms of your own understanding. But also if you if you are in need of additional help, we can talk about those. We can talk about safety planning. I mean, one of the one of the important things is to try and help you find a way to make sure that you feel good about keeping yourself and in your baby safe. And we can talk about that. We can talk about finances. You mentioned that you were thinking about going back to work but that you were relying on him right now. We can certainly For that a little bit more, taking care of yourself which, yeah, right.  Yeah, yeah, for many, many new new moms that's hard under any circumstances to find a way to take care of themselves and keep themselves healthy. So that's certainly something we can talk about. And also just the whole issue about taking care of your child and, and your, your mothering your parenting, how you might, how you might focus on that and in this situation, or there might be something else that you feel is really important to deal with right up front. Just to start with, what do you think? Well, it's, it's funny as you're showing me this, I I've been thinking, all I've been doing is focusing on the baby and being a good mom and and, and yet, I'm also trying to think about getting a job and I don't know how those two fit together. And even as I'm just saying that out loud. I'm not even talking about taking care of him. Which is weird that I'm not even when I look at this these circles I am looking at mothering and children and finances and that seems to be important yet I'm spent I spend so much time thinking about him all the time and right now I'm not so maybe you spend a lot of time already thinking about your relationship and really struggling with what what it means and where it is. And now you're kind of think well, maybe I think about some other things and see where I might go with those. These things if the job and taking learning how to be a better mother and might be a might help the relationship so that might be so might be a way that focusing on how you might be able to take care of yourself get get a job or look at the possibility of doing that and the same time trying to incorporate you're taking care of your child that those things might help you um Free you up to figure out then what to do about the relationship? What to do about the relationship? Yeah, what to do about the relationship? I'm not sure what to do with a relationship. Yeah. You know, you're the only one that that really will know about that about the dealing with the relationship about what, when the timing is right for any decision that you make one way or the other. I don't even know what to think about that. I don't know how to. Yeah, I don't feel like I've been making any decisions.  Yeah. Well, and it sounds like you'd like to think about making some decisions in other areas. And, and when you think about that, is that right? Would you like to focus a little bit on just the possibility of getting a job? If that's something you'd like to talk about?  Yeah. And how to balance that with being a mom at the same time, because that sounds really hard. Well, you mentioned earlier that you had kind of been thinking about going back to work when after the baby was born, what what thoughts do you have about how you might go about balancing that? And and in thinking about thinking about that, what have you thought about? Well, I guess I think initially that I would need his help more, he would need to help take care of the baby. He doesn't do that. Now. So I don't know. And it be kind of scary that I don't know what that would look like. So I would have to find some other help to get to be able to go to work even just part time, so I could get some childcare or something. Yeah.  So you might have to explore some other options for the child care and in other ways of taking care of the baby so that you would be feel okay about going back to work? Yeah. Yeah. Somebody I trusted. Yeah. And I'd have to figure out just the timing of that and a job that would fit a schedule where I could still breastfeed and help her with her naps and make sure I'm there for bedtime and all those important times, but make enough money that it was worthwhile to, to do it. Yeah, to be out and working and paying somebody. That sounds like a lot. It really does sound, though, like you, you're really deeply committed to taking care of your child and providing the kind of structure and, and, and things the basic needs and really taking care of your child at the same time.  Umm Mm hmm. It's very important to me. I didn't I didn't think I was I wanted to have children. And then we did so. I would like him to be a daddy in that. Wow. Just well as I was thinking about him not being around as the daddy and I'm not really sure what to do with that. But the baby the baby is the most important thing right now. Right I didn't realize that I've spent so much time thinking about him all the time. And when we can hear back and does he love us? And why the heck did he do that that weird thing and why does he care about these other things that he cares about? Like being jealous, not wanting you to have friends? Yeah, why does he. And it has nothing to do with what I'm thinking about now, which is the baby and but it's, we've mentioned that a couple times now that it that it sort of surprises you, the way you're thinking about it in the way you're approaching it. Like you're recognizing we're seeing that you've spent a lot of time really agonizing over over the relationship and, and why things are happening in the relationship or what it really means you've spent a lot of time there. That kind of surprises you that you might be thinking about it differently agonizing I guess that's what I've been doing. I feel like I've just been hoping and wishing and it seems like all my focus is always so when the baby's crying and I'm worrying about him and and and so the baby crying is just it's hard, but but if just now talking about it letting go of worrying about it feels kind of freeing that I could actually think about why the baby's crying as opposed to why why is he not returning my calls? or Why did he give me that look, when I you know, talked about getting a job and things like that it's not so interesting.  So you're realizing to how much it really takes to focus attention on on the baby. And to be able to Do it and it's like I it's hard to do both. It's hard to really think about doing both. I need his help with that. Yeah, I don't need to be worrying about him too. Hmm I don't understand what safety planning means. Well, one of the things that we we look at is trying to help people who are in a situation similar to you where, where there might be some where there might be some fear about something that could that might happen, or you know, and I know you said he had indicated that he wouldn't do it again. But sometimes it really helps people to feel to have some plans in place for what you would do if anything came up and how to get you and your baby safe, if that's what needs to happen. So if he kind of got that weird look in his eye again, which actually I've seen before, but he just never really did anything like this before. He just went farther this time?  Yeah. Okay, so like, if I recognize if I saw that look What to do?  Yeah, yeah. And, and, and sometimes that ties in with, you know, there might be places that you can go to get saved, there might be steps that you can take to, to really keep yourself safe or make sure that the baby's safe for people to call or think just things that you can do based on what your life is like and what you what resources you have available to you. Is that something you're interested in really exploring? Sounds kind of freaky to think that I would have to keep myself safe from somebody that says he loves me and you know, love the baby. Sounds a little strange. Some ways it just seems like it shouldn't have to be that way. No, shouldn't have to be  that way. But I didn't expect him to do what he did either. So That kind of came out of nowhere really took you by surprise. It's something that you're just trying to figure out where, how does this fit and what it what does it mean? And what do I do with it? What what how do I how do I respond to this?  Yeah, it doesn't seem real. So I guess, thinking about thinking about that kind of makes sense ahead of time. Yeah. Well, let me see if I if I got it all and then we can make some decisions about where to move from here or how to take the next step with that. I want to make sure I understand a little bit about your situation.  Okay And this first of all, this is the first time you've come in. This is the first time that you've had something that really happened, this incident that happened where he pushed you really prompted you to to take some steps because it scared you and you you are wanting to protect yourself and your baby. You Really want to protect the baby, you have this relationship that's been cut off and on and but he's been very supportive and helpful in terms of giving you meeting your basic needs and the baby's basic needs and wants to take care of you and, and there are times when it's really good. And there are times when you've been less sure and this is this incident has also made you to kind of think about that some of the ways that you've been thinking about or thinking about it now kind of surprises you but you're looking at thinking about the possibility of maybe working it out to go back to work a little bit so that you can have more financial independence, if you will, or be able to take care of yourself at the for those times when you need to. And you're starting to toy with the idea of maybe it might be useful to have a really good plan to keep yourself safe. Did I kind of get it all that yeah, that kind of captures it all. Yes. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know where to start. But I guess that's why I'm talking to you.  Yeah.Yeah. So maybe we can, we can take that next step in and when when when we get together again and we can do that we can just take the next step and start looking at some planning for both of those in both of those areas for keeping yourself safe and, and for, you know, looking at the possibilities because there are options and resources out there should you choose to make the decision to go back to work, there are some options for you. So there's like a good somebody can help me work on my resume or something like that. There are other options for for a variety of things and we can make some have some discussions about that. Okay. Okay. Does that sound That sounds good. Okay, nice.  Well, I really appreciate again, you're coming in today, and we will follow up with this conversation and in it, you you will have it hopefully to give you what you needed to make any decisions that You need and again they are your decisions about what if anything you want to change and what your next step is.  Thank you. I think I'll go get my baby from childcare and well, should we make another appointment or something?  Yes, let's make another appointment. Okay. Thank you.","Patient was feeling strange.

102,"Summarize: Vanessa, Hi, nice to see you again. It's good to see you. Yeah. How are you? I'm doing okay. And you know, things have been settling down a bit, I think. Yeah, the last time we saw things were pretty chaotic and hectic when you were being released from the hot discharge from the house. for about a week ago, yeah, yes,  your how's your injury? It's it's pretty pain, you know, had a lot of pain in it. I've been kind of trying not to take too much pain medication and just kind of trying to keep busy and focus on things that are happening. I've been busy with my church duties and with my kids  you even trying to stay fit. Yeah, yeah, it's been hard to think about myself when I have so many other things that are more way more important than me to deal with. How are your kids doing? They're doing okay, you know, the little ones were pretty kind of stressed out when I first got home and they were a little unsure of themselves and what was going to happen but the older the older kids have helped out quite a bit. So I think they're pulling together. Imagine that there's some you know, period of readjustment and healing and sadness or as in It sounds like also just trying to get things done.  yeah, I mean, my motto is just to keep moving, you know, moving as fast as I can, trying to get, you know, keep the house clean and be good, you know, with my duties with my church and trying to keep the kids focused on their activities and not to be too focused on what's happening in me and Paul's life because you know, there's nothing they can do about that.  Mm hmm. So here, you're taking care of a lot of people, your community, your kids, all the while trying to take care of yourself. That's a lot.  Yeah. I really appreciate you showing up today given how much you have on your plate and how much you you have going on. Well, you know, last time that we met you had talked about how important it is for you to do what you can to keep your kids and yourself safe. And I was wondering if you'd be interested in talking a little bit more about that today? Or perhaps if there's something else that you would rather talk about No, I, you know, I made time today to talk about this. I think it's really important to try to figure something out things got very out of hand there. And so it's, it's, I'm looking forward to thinking about what what things I can do. So, so you were scared. It sounds like you were scared.  It was terrifying. I mean, we police were called, you know, we ended up having to call the police. And Paul was arrested and spent some time in jail. I had Child Welfare folks crawling all over my house and my mom was upset and neighbors were all being nosy and gossiping. And it's, it's it was just very scary. So so a lot of things were turned upside down. And when you say it was scary, I hear you saying on some level was scary for you and your your safety but it also sounds like it was scary because all these other variables or elements were put in motion that were disruptive, right? I mean, it was, you know, we had people come into the house calling and you know, checking in, are you okay? Or can you get a restraining order and my mom was trying to get me to move in with her and you know, it's just too many, you know, too many cooks in the kitchen. So a lot of people have some ideas about what you should be doing. ' Yeah, yeah, so I'm just really I'm not I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna get a restraining order. I'm not gonna call the police. It's no he knows where I live.  so say more about that say more about why you why you don't want to call the police or you don't want to get a restraining order. They were they were throwing him on the ground. They were holding his arms behind his back and They have their guns and you know that kind of you never know what the police are going to do to a black man. You never know whether he's going to make it to the jail safely. So I was I was terrified for him. And then the next day, you know, Child Welfare call in the house. It sounds like that was a very scary experience in moment for you. Yeah. Because I'm a good mom. And given that experience, you're it sounds like you're part you're maybe not as inclined to think about calling the police again.  Yeah, no, no, I've told my mom that that's, you know, that's a last resort. And that I'm going to be meeting with some folks and thinking about other options. And that's what you'd like to talk about today the alternatives to calling the police. Absolutely. Well, what have you thought about so far? What other ideas do you have about what you might do? In a serious moment where you're scared Mm hmm. For your your well being and that of your kids ? I think I'm most afraid. You know that something might happen that will be really crazy and really out of control. And so I've been thinking about what kinds of things I could do if things are crazy and out of control. And I've just thought about maybe talking to somebody or talking to my minister about it was came to my mind because he's somebody who we've talked to before. Okay. Yeah So, your minister, someone that you're thinking about talking to a little bit about what's going on in your relationship? What are your thoughts? What would you What would you say to your minister, what would you like to tell your minister? I'm really, I'm really interested in telling him more of the truth of what's happening in my relationship he doesn't know about He has no idea that Paul has threatened to kill me. And then he's starting to kill himself and the children. He knows we've had some marital problems, some financial problems. He knows that Paul's had some drinking problems. So there's some of that, but he doesn't know about him threatening to kill us or that he's been hitting me or his rages. So I feel like, you know, that it's time to tell them, you know, tell him some of that stuff. You feel like you've been keeping some significant information from your what would be some reasons why you would tell him these things, what might be some advantages or reasons to do that? He's been helpful before, he's really helped us a lot. we've, we've had counseling with him over the last five years, numerous times. And he has been very helpful to someone that you trust someone that you have a relationship with, and he's been helpful in what ways is he been helpful? You know, I think Paul respects him as a man. And I think he cares about Paul. So he's not you know, my mom and my dad and my friends. They they're they're really bordering on hating Paul. And they don't. I don't feel like they have any objectivity when it comes to working with him that my pastor has some objectivity. And I think he cares about Paul, it sounds like your pastors able to see him as a whole, complicated human being in the same ways that that you do perhaps  that there's this side of him that's scary and that you don't like and then there's this other aspect of him that you, you really do appreciate. And you feel like your pastor would likely be able to do that as well. What would be another reason to talk to your pastor, in addition to this being someone you trust, and that Paul might listen to what would be another  I don't think that he's going to likely go storming into, you know, our pastor's house, Paul. That Paul won't You know, he's gonna he'll he comes back in at my mom's door and he goes, you know, storming over to my girlfriend's house. But he's not likely to do that. Yeah, I don't think you will. So so. So your pastor's home actually might be a physically safe place for you all to go? Right..to cool off Hmm Because things got so out of control and crazy, you know, and and that's not going to happen again.  So you've said that a few times now that things got so out of control and crazy. Tell me tell me a little bit more about how what that was? you know, you know, my eldest son got involved. My arm was was, was harmed and things were broken. He threatened to kill me and he threatened to kill all of us. And I had to call the police and I had to, you have people coming into my house, tromping through my house, grabbing Paul hurting him. You know, he called me from jail and how can you do this? You know, what have you done? You know, I felt like what have I done? How can I do this?  Right. So so not only was it so scary in the heat of the moment where you feared for your life and the life of your children, but afterwards, it was scary as well, because of all the things that all that Fallout. Yeah. So so. So going to your pastors talking to your pastor, possibly seeing if his house might be a place that you could run to temporarily might be something to explore and those are advantages. Are there any disadvantages, like what would be some possible disadvantages to talking to your pastor about what's been going on in your relationship? that Paul will know, you know, if he finds out that I've talked to our minister about this? You know, I have no doubt how angry he will be. So this could really be a trigger a significant trigger? Yes, he finds out about it. So that's a little bit of a difficult situation. Yeah. As you think about this particular part of a safety plan, on the one hand, there's potentially some real advantages and positives to speaking to your minister. And at the same time, there's this possible significant risk. When you think about, you know, the pros and the cons in this situation, what do you what do you make of that? What do you Where do you go with that? It's, it's a risk I'm willing to take, you know, I have thought about this. And it was, you know, things got so out of control. And I feel like it's time to do something different and to think about how we're going to do this differently. You're, you're really concerned.  Yeah. And a part of you is really worried about the next time. And you appreciate that there are some risks involved in some of the safety planning. And you also feel like it's a risk that you're, you're willing to take given what is at stake. And really, it sounds like you feel like your life and your children's lives maybe at stake. You know, I think that things can't continue the way that they are. I have to figure out something that's going to work for me and for my kids and for Paul. Would it be right with you if I offered just a suggestion or a thought something to think about in terms of kids and safety planning is something that I know other moms in a similar situation similar to yours have done and that is, sit down and have a conversation with their kids about identifying a safe person to either call or run to in the moment When things are if, if things get really crazy and out of hand, I'd be curious to hear what your thoughts are about doing that with your kids. I think my oldest, my oldest son, that would be a really helpful thing for him because he wants to know what he can do. He wants to do something he's always jumping in. That's how I got hurt in the first place because he was jumping in. So helping him identify something that he can do that will keep us safe and to keep him safe would would be a great idea. Yeah, you so you see this perhaps as a way of kind of not pulling him out of a violence situation, but having him turn away from a violent situation as opposed to turn into it without done. Yeah, he's becoming a man now, too. He, he needs to have an option of what he can do to keep his family safe.  Yeah. And as he's becoming a man and thinking about how to protect you, you're also really concerned about protecting him and keeping him safe. And I've heard you identify a few things that you're thinking about doing or would like to do. And things that you feel like you actually do have control over. Last time we talked to you, you were very clear about the fact that you can't control Paul, when he's in his fear and his rage and being violent. And what I've heard you very clearly say that you want is to figure out what you can control. You can't control him, but there are some things you have control over and specifically for you that is maybe talking to possibly a safe person, your minister.  Yes. And having that conversation to see if that might be a safe person in place to go to and, and then the other pieces may be having a conversation with your oldest child, at least about who to call in the moment.  Yeah. And I confident Vanessa that you will be able to put a plan together that will work for you and your family and I'm here to support you in any, any way that I can. And if it's at all helpful, I'd be happy to follow up with you in a few days and see if you feel the need to talk about it some more. Thank you I'd ppreciate that. Thanks for your time. Thank you.","Last time patient was chaotic and hectic when released from the hot discharge.

103,"Summarize: Hi Kyle, How are doing today ? Umm not not too good. Not so good ? No, I just got into a fight my parents what's been going on? Well, I I've been doing heroin for for a few months now. And I didn't think my parents knew but I guess they they found a needle in my room. And I mean they knew what I was doing. And they they told me that I have to start shaping up and I need to I need to stop doing any kind of drugs because they said they said the next time that they find find any kind of drugs and it's, it's it, they're gonna kick me out of the house. Alright, so they're at the point where anything else happens they discover it and you're on the street.  Right What are your feelings about being on the street? Who want to be out there ever? I don't know who would be. I mean it would be hard just to kind of stop cold turkey and I know a couple buddies that did that and it's it's not good when you get junk sick. And I mean, I'm kind of stuck because I don't know. I don't want to be out in the streets, but it's just gonna be so hard. So hard to give So there are conflicting feelings here. You don't want to be out in the street. But you don't want to give up the heroin same time. Right, Right. I just I mean, I don't want to give it up. But, I mean, I kind of know I have to. I mean, I'm a young guy, I I couldn't make it outside of my parents house and I definitely don't want to be on the streets. So you want to stop to avoid the consequences could happen. Right. But to this point haven't been able to. So this is the first consequence or potential consequences motivated you Right since you started using Yeah How strong is the craving to use? I mean when I first started it was I mean it was pretty freakin great. I mean the rush that you get from it it's it's just mind blowing it's it's just amazing. But of I've noticed recently that like the rush isn't as intense anymore and it's even like it's even kind of started to backfire a little bit where like actually I'll feel all sick without using it. And I mean that kind of scares me but the cravings are definitely still there. Right so when you when you try to cut back, have you tried to cut back? I had before but a minute like there there is no reason to so I didn't try very hard. When you did try Did you have the feeling Were you getting sick? I did. Yeah, it was an A it wasn't as bad as as any of my buddies but I definitely I mean I didn't I didn't feel well have your parents given you any options in terms of like Do they understand that your seems like you're a little dependent on Yeah, I mean they they do I definitely like I don't hold anything against my parents I got you I have a pretty good relationship with them. I know what I'm doing isn't isn't good for me. And they they said that they would completely support me they they told me that they have a place picked out where I can go and that they'd be willing to pay for it and everything but they said if I you know if I don't meet them halfway then it's just that's it like it's they're done. So they have a solution in a sense for what's going on. silica is like a detox. It is okay detox right.  So they have a they have a solution to help get you off the heroin, but there's still, there's still a part of you that doesn't want to go that route. I mean, that you know, I think I think I'm starting to come to terms and it's that it's time to stop and it might be good that maybe I'm stopping so early. I know. I know. My friends have been doing it for a lot longer than I have. But I just Yeah, I don't I don't know if the detox gonna work. I mean, it's, it's hard for me to focus on like anything until sometimes until I get my next fix. Right. So there's, there's a few problems here. So So one is can you can you commit to going to detox and the second is, even if you successfully complete that, when you come back out, if you can build void the power right It's tough right now cuz actually my, my dealer lives in my neighborhood. I mean, he's, I mean, he's just like a few few houses down. My my girlfriend lives in our community too. And like, he's he's on the way to her house. So a girl kind of just maybe pick it up on my way. And third, third, my bookbag and getting out my girlfriend bit and then maybe on my way back home, I'll shoot up the buddy. So right. So you so really, you're running into them as you walk to your girlfriend's house.  Right. Yeah. And he's there and the temptations is great. And I mean, it's like that house is kind of, that's actually where I shoot up a lot. So it's like whenever it is  in his house? right, right. So it's like, whenever whenever I'm coming up to his house, I'm like, I start start getting excited, you know, like, sir anticipating how how great it's, it's gonna feel the next time. And it's I know it's like stuck with me I get I get excited when it's as well as you know, feeling so so it's exploiters. As soon as you're walking up to the wall as you're getting ready to pass this house Sumo like to all the way to your girlfriend, you divert to kind of go to his house and you have this feeling of excitement. What's the thought that's going through your mind? I like I kind of, I just can't wait for the for the next hit. Now I got passes how since my parents are giving me an ultimatum. And now it's kind of mixed because I'm like, man, if I if I get to do that, and somehow they find out like, it's, it's kind of all over for me. And then but on the other hand, I'm thinking about how How great it's gonna be. I'm just kind of like I'm planning in my mind how much I'm going to do and what kind of plans we'll have for the rest of the night. Okay, so you have a you have a few things going on. Do you think like, is your plan right now to go into the detox? It is. Yeah, it's Yeah. I mean, my, my definite plan is to go into detox and if the detox works, like, I mean, I think I can be done with it. But it's just I don't I don't know if the detox can work. And I mean, I've never only tried to cut back that one time. And I mean, I don't know how good I'll be at it. You know, let's let's presume for a second that the detox would be successful and you you wouldn't be one even you wouldn't be on heroin coming out of detox. Right, right. Are you worried at that point that you'll go right back? I don't know if I'll go right back. Like I think if I can get off at the detox actually work. So with that said, Do I think I could stay off it, I think like, my, I think my cravings will still always be there. But now that it's like, now that I've come to the realization that some of the stuff that I can lose if I get caught, I mean, if I can get off it for good, I don't, I don't like I feel back. It might be hard, like if I run into my buddy or something.  That's that's the point of worry right? Right. so there's there is a concern that you'll you could, you could go back if you run into them? right. If you could stay away from him. You think you increase your chances of being successful? I mean, yeah, definitely. I won't like there's there's so many like, experiences in this house. That that kind of to feed into the anticipation and the cravings. I mean, if that doesn't happen, you probably help When you plans in terms of going into detox? Pretty soon I think I'm supposed to go on Monday after the weekend. So like three days okay. So it it actually sounds like what your parents have put in place you believe will work. Right? You have confidence that will work. And that your worry is what will you have is when you get out can you avoid it when your friends right You don't buy from anybody else other than your friends. No No So so that's really becomes the maybe one of your key goals here since since your cake. Sounds like you're committed to the detox part. Right and you know, some reading that incorrectly that that seems to be something you're no Yeah, if it works, and then I can try. So it's it's preparing for life after detox right? and avoiding wait for the phrase people places things through with with the addictions or, or substance use. So in this case you need to avoid it would seem your friend we're and and where he lives right which is unfortunately not far from you and in between because houses in between your house and your girlfriend  right so is there a way it's may seem a little odd but there's a way to walk around the block where you can completely avoid his house and still get to your girlfriend's house. Yeah, I mean there is this is kind of out of the way but I think yeah I could go there's like a like a horseshoe path. I could. Yeah, I could. I could like go up the block and I'm like around the horseshoe and then and then I can like turn right and get her house there. She would never even see his house. Right Right. have other options as well. So there's that option. How about her coming over to where your parents that was that ever happened before? Um, I mean, yeah, she's she's come over. So maybe if like, maybe if I tell her that it'll, you know, help me out she can like she can make that walk and I'll be like, it'll be easier because she can walk right by the house without problem, right right I if I are walking out of the house, it'd be harder for me to actually do what I'm supposed to. So if I can't even leave, and she comes at I might be best,  and to get to work, do you have to pass his house? No, no, I, like I worked on the road. So I just drive like I drive all the way out to the community. So there's kind of some like, really, there's a physical kind of slash behavioral strategy here, which is just physically keeping you away from having to go by his house and sounds like the only reason other than to, to buy and use drugs is to see your girlfriend.  Right. There's an alternative strategy here, right? She She comes to you, or you could go all the way around, and then only round back to return. And to get back and forth to work. You don't have to go by his house at all.  Yeah, I could do that. I'm gonna work.  Is there ever a time where he comes to you? I'm honestly not that much. Now. He obviously he doesn't. He doesn't really like to leave his house much. He's he's kind of going on always there. So that's kind of he just deals out of there and then shoots up there. So he, he stays in his house most of the time and he doesn't even come out. And we, you know, we know that there's on my thoughts, we've talked about this before, right, that is on Mac thoughts that lead to feelings and behaviors.  Right, right.  And can you identify a specific thought that may occur or maybe has occurred? Not really. walking by his house, but when you've been in your house like this, maybe it's motivated you to go walk to his house, right. I'm bored. Okay, yeah, just straight up. I mean, when when there's nothing to do in the house, my parents are gone. So it's a it's the best way to have fun. So you've identified a thought that that directly connects to the behavior you want, which is on board. So onboard leads to using the drug assuming because that would alleviate the boredom? right. Is there an adaptive response that you can put in right there that you can interject right at that moment? When you say, board? Is there a depth of response to couplets as soon as this post detox. Right, right.  Sounds like that's your plan. You're sitting in your house detox is done. There's no more you know, we would hope withdrawal type symptoms right. The thought comes upon you I'm bored. What's It's a self talk piece that could be interjected there. Um, I think like if I if I remember to think what I don't want to do when I think that I'm bored, like I just kind of come up something else. So I right now my usually my two choices when I'm bored are either to go to my buddy's house, or go to my gril's houses, you know, across from my buddy. So maybe that could just be like, one of the times I called my girl and be like, Hey, can you just like come over? We can do something like just kind of distract me from from, like, wanting to go over dance place, you know? So to the adaptive responses, call you girlfriend. right yeah. On board and, and she, you know, sounds like what's voice that she's really supportive of? Yeah, yeah, I mean, she wasn't too happy with me doing it she doesn't use so I mean there's there's that social All, she'll be on board for that. It seems like consequences motivates you. Right. And that's what brought you in today like to practice anyway. So I'm wondering if another adapter response response could involve, you know, I don't want any, any trouble. You know, and you can substitute a lot of words in for trouble. There's all kinds of trouble that can occur from using heroin, right So getting kicked out of house, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to get kicked out my house. I'm clean. And there's something else I can do here other than drugs,  right Like I'm thinking in times and your girlfriend might not be around. Okay. Right. So you still want to have you want to have adaptive response. That's not necessarily tied to a person in case she isn't around. Right can use that one certainly, that's a good one, when she's not around. And you kind of revisit those consequences, new adaptive response. Do you think that's going to be enough motivation to keep you from going to the house? Yeah, I do. I mean I like as of right now, work scones good, like school is going good. I don't, I really don't want any problems. And I think like now If i don't realize that if I if I do keep using, it's not just going to be something like that I do when I'm bored or like that I'm doing for fun it's going to turn into like a problem that's going to kind of affects everything else. So I think like, if I just remember to tell myself, like when I'm feeling bored if I just remember to tell myself like I don't, I don't want to be out in the streets and like especially I don't want to lose my job. Like I think telling myself those things that will help remind me like kind of what's at stake. You know Good, good. So it sounds like you have some some adaptive responses to use. Nothing occurs to me is your parents around much Yeah, I mean, they're my dad works a lot. My mom's usually she works to a single part time job. So she's usually like home at night. And night one of the times and you have gone over to your friend's house,  well it's actually it's more during the day, it's more kind of day. So she could be an asset in terms of trying to stop you from leaving the house, but only when she's there.  Right. And similar to your father, you know, so it's really, I guess we kind of narrow it down to when you're home alone and particularly when your girlfriend's not available, that's your highest risk time right?  Yeah. So we have the cognitive adaptive responses to come employment, what was anything more behavioral, we can do like can you can you go somewhere else? Well, I think like one of the one of the other things I do to kind of clear my head as I like to go for a drive. So like if I if I start feeling bored I think maybe if I like get in my car And like I said, all of that that's his stuff. I just drive away, like, just physically leave the temptation. And then like from there, I can go to a bookstore or like a comic book store like I can, I could spend hours in there. So maybe if I can, like I can remind myself to drive away, go to the stores, and like, maybe I can just kind of stay out there like enough till either like my girlfriend's home or my parents come home. I think that's a good I think it's a good plan. Yeah. and remember that the more we apply these adaptive responses, right, what we hope is that you the risk decreases, like your craving decreases your motivation to stay clean increases right. So while it may be only convenient to drive someplace, every time no one's available, and you'd have thought that might not be something I do forever.  Right, right.  But that'll That'll minimize the risk for now. And we want to, we want to focus on the short term first. And then we'll worry more about the midterm and long term right? Then circumstances may change, maybe you he reside there forever. Maybe some of his work schedule change. Maybe there are other adaptations you can make.  Right But But for now, I think this would be a good way to go. Just keeping you away from the circumstance,  right? You definitely don't want, right. So good news, a few behavioral pieces we have in here and then a few cognitive as well. So I want to see in a couple of days before we go into detox okay so that we can practice some of these adaptive responses are like good practice some at home. Between now right as well. Right. Yeah and these behavioral responses as well. But we'll try to get them shored up before detox and I'll see it right after you come out as well. Okay. We'll make sure that we just keep working on applying and refining his adaptive cognitive responses and his adaptive behavioral responses. Right. Does that sound like a plan? Yeah, definitely. I think that will definitely help. Especially especially being in here and after detox. That would definitely, definitely be the best I appreciate you coming in Jesse, and I'll see you in a couple days.  Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.","Patient got into fight with parents because of using heroin. They foun a needle in room. Patient had conflicting feelings about giving up heroin. Patient dont want to be on the street.

104,"Summarize: Hi Hazel, how are you doing today?  Okay What's been going on? Well, last time I started to tell you a little bit about one of my friends, my best friend Actually, she had this issue. So what happened was she went to a bathroom at our local library, and she found a video camera when she was going to the bathroom in the bathroom? Yeah, she actually, yeah. And she turned it into the police. And I guess because like she carried it, or she had found it. Her hand prints were on it and they weren't able to they weren't able to detect who actually did it. They weren't able to catch the  probably didn't catch the person? No. So send Then I've been on really just high alert, like, I'm worried that that could happen to me to my kids. And I'm just really worried because they didn't catch the guy that him or someone like him could be out there. So he's still out in the community, right? So how is it affecting your your daily life? Can you tell me kind of what your where you've been feeling? A lot of anxiety just not knowing maybe, you know, what if someone were to videotape me like that, I've been very aware, shall I say, of cameras. Okay, so anxious and aware, right, Like, I know you have one in your office and people on their cell phone cameras. Right Just all the possibilities that I could be recorded. I've just been very aware of them which makes me not want to go anywhere. So I've been having Arguing with my husband a lot because he wants to go out to restaurants and I don't want to go because there could be cameras in the bathrooms and how I dress also as you can see him kind of dress more conservatively because I remember hearing once about cameras that people use on shoes that could be you, you know use in a creepy way and so I I can't you know it's now almost summertime I can't dress and skirt or be comfortable because I'm dressing like that. So you have covered a lot of ground there. So you have the you have the feeling of being like worried nervous, whether that's gonna happen to you. But you've also had to kind of change your routine or you have to change routine to feel safer.  Right has that helped has has changed in the way you dressed or changing where you go and when you go is that help reduce the anxiety? Not really no, I would say it's really starting. That's why I wanted to come in. It's really starting to affect my life. You mentioned specifically your husband has, like what's been going on here?  He just wants to go places with our kids like go out to eat and and I don't really want to go anywhere that because you know cameras are everywhere nowadays. They are And I just kind of worried like public bathrooms Could they be there someone being you know, sometimes baby monitors or you know have two phones and people can hack into that. Laptop cameras. So even in my own house, I've just been really nervous. So I feel like I'm not really getting relief from that anxiety. Have you taken any precautions because of this persistent worry. I mean, I've read  I was already mentioned like with the camera specifically. I mean, I've um, you know, when I go into bathrooms I I've been looking for cameras to make sure they weren't there before you know me or my children that needs a bathroom. I have tried, I read online You can learn how to turn off the cameras on your phone, and that you can close your laptop in that way the camera will face down. So, and the same thing on a smart TV so it doesn't recognize your face. I've I've tried to turn things off, they don't need to be on as far as people being able to access myown information  and that seems reasonable. Once you take reasonable precautions to try to avoid being video recorded,  right against your will. Exactly. But still, you have this feeling of worry anxiety and your your schedules being interfered with? right. skewed you'd like to cope more effectively with your feelings, reduces anxiety. So when you enter into a public bathroom and we talked about automatic thoughts before those thoughts it just kind of pop into our head and they connect to feelings. That can be unpleasant right. Like anxiety and worry. So when you walk into a public restroom, what's the first thing that goes through your mind? that there might be a video camera that I don't see that that's maybe like with my friend that was big enough, but I might not catch it in that someone's going to use that in a vulgar way. Okay, so when you walk in, you're wondering if there's a camera there.  Yeah. And when that automatic thought occurs, what follows that in terms of a feeling or behavior? Usually I'll try and find the camera but it's usually anxiety fear. My heart rate starts going up, I start getting really anxious and then you know, I try and either rush to use the bathroom if I really have to go or a lot of times if I don't, I'll just leave. Sometimes I try and use bathroom at home so I don't have to go out. So you behaviors looking for the camera or sometimes just leaving without using a restroom. And you're You're feeling is that that anxiety worry there? Yeah,  we've been talking about. Okay. So, really, if we think about, we talked before about the core beliefs, intermediate beliefs, and wonder if the intermediate belief, isn't it, I'm vulnerable. Or this more specifically, maybe it's more of a core belief. More specifically, I'm vulnerable in this area, like put this guy on the loose right,  you know, committed that crime. And then, you know, that's combining with situations that you encounter, and that's where you're getting those automatic thoughts. So that sort of makes sense. Exactly. Okay. So you remember what, what in terms of kind of therapy, you'd like to apply what we call the adaptive response or self talk. So it's that thought that you interject at that moment you realize you're having an automatic thought, that's going to be to in this case, anxiety and worry and behaviors that are looking for the camera isn't maybe useful behavior, but leaving, you know, that's that that could certainly be on useful behavior. So in terms of that self talk, let's let's work to develop a self talk response so that you could tell yourself to that initial, you know, I wonder if there's a camera in this bathroom. Right? What do you think you could tell yourself that would get in between that thought and the feelings you're having? I could say if when I walked in the bathroom? Umm hmm maybe I could say, Umm you know, while there could be a chance that there's a camera in this bathroom, the chance of it happening is not very likely. And You know, I'm gonna take steps to keep myself safe, so that I won't be in a vulnerable position such as looking for the camera. But it's good. So you have, you have a low probability of it happening, and you're taking useful behaviors to minimize your risk even further.  Right. Right. So that's a good automatic thought, I think are good adaptive response for the next thought rather. Why don't you Why don't you try that one out? Right, the next time. You had that on that thought? Right. Try out that. You know, I think that's really, you know, that's logical. I mean, it's, it's unlikely to happen. Of course, there's a chance. Right, right. And we, we acknowledge that in the self talk, there's a chance that it could happen, but there's precautions you can take. That's a low chance sometimes as well, so keep that on Mac thought. We'll review it In the end,  okay,  right before you leave today, we'll write these down. But that's that's one adaptive response rather that I want to write down for you. I also want to talk about like, the worst case scenario, because right now you have the anxiety worry about an event that while it's unlikely it could happen. It could happen. And I'm wondering how you think you would react? If it is the worst did happen if you if you use the restroom, and you found out through law enforcement or by finding a camera that an offender had been, you know, watching you right on recording. How would react to that? I mean, I think I would be really upset. I think I would feel vulnerable probably for a while and be hesitant. I mean, I would think ultimately, that would be okay. My friend is happened a while ago, she's starting to get to get over it and get back to her usual routine, although she's still hesitant, so I think I would be okay. Eventually, although I'd be really upset that it happened. And it would make sense to feel upset. But that would be upsetting for anybody. But as you noted, that would probably be relatively temporary.  That's right. distress, right? Well, acute, and certainly, you wouldn't be happy about it. It shouldn't be happy about it.  Right It would probably go away. I learned to adapt. How long have you been in the state of anxiety and worry? Probably it happened like two months, two months? And how many days and the average week are you affected by these feelings? Every day,  every day? Yeah. So if we can compare it right, we have a chance to be recorded, right illegally. That's a low probability event. It could happen. Probably not likely. The anxiety and worry that you're having. That's a high probability event because you're suffering from every day. And that's true. I never thought about it that way. So there's a, there's a point at which maybe you reach and you say, I'd rather take that route to take the risk, I'd rather deal with the potential consequences of that an unlikely event to be recorded and face that if it happens, then be in the state of anxiety, worry right, Because right now I'm suffering every day. Now you're suffering, right? And if, if you could adaptively respond effectively, you you're still gonna have that risk of being recorded. But you know, you could survive that event if it happened late. I can get it And you're taking reasonable cautions and you know, things we talked about. So, as you think about this in a more general sense, is there a adaptive response, you could apply it to that, to that on that thought of, you know, I need to be worried about This or, you know, whatever that thought looks like sometimes the thoughts in image rights may like an image have been recorded, but whatever that kind of general series of automatic thoughts are that are that are getting you anxious or worried before you even get out of the house. What adapter response? Could you apply there? Maybe, you know, like I said, I'm worried about all the cameras, maybe I could say, you know, I understand there's some cameras that, you know, use for good purposes, security,  probably most are right. And the chances of being recorded illegally are not likely if, and I'm taking precautions to you know, go to the right places. The good areas, good areas. So it's not likely to happen overall. And me going outside the house is worth the risk. You know, the minimal risk that it would happen and if it did happen, I could survive. That's great. That's a great adaptive Yeah. And actually, that's kind of a few adaptive responses.  Right, right.  But that's good. And you can you can apply them and we'll, we'll kind of break them down.  Okay. Like I said, before you leave today, we'll break those down. So you can, you could have written down as you go out. I think it's important, because the automatic thoughts tend to spring on us quickly. It's important to rehearse these adaptive responses. So we're ready to go.  Okay. Right. And, and kind of, you know, we're being we're preparing ourselves to apply that adaptive response. And in order to be prepared you, you have to know what it is. So it's good to have it written down to kind of more or less commit to memory.  Okay. Does that make sense? Yeah. All right. So, before we leave today, I'll take care of that. And I want you to use as adaptive responses for this week. I'll see you next week. And record what the outcome Was every time you're able to apply the response, and that includes what you felt and what you actually did.  Okay. And of course, as you mentioned, any physiological reactions like your heart racing, right underneath that, so that's really that sub behavior. But note both a physiological behaviors and other behaviors.  Okay Yeah. Once you're consciously controlling, and then any feelings, okay? And we'll go through them. We'll go through each time use it one by one, they have a there are and kind of see if we need to adjust the adaptive response and see how well it's working. Okay. That's the plan. Yeah. I think that will be helpful So we'll go from there. And I appreciate you coming in today. Thank you very much. Thanks.",One of the patients friend had an issue that she founf video camera at local library bathroom and she turned it into the police but they were not able to catch the person.

105,"Summarize: Hi Joe, How are doing today? I'm doing okay just okay? Well, I know we've talked before about me thinking about suicide and I'm starting to think about it, you know, like a little bit stronger than before, I think a little bit more clearly. So, can you can tell me a little bit more about that? Um, well, one we've talked before, I've had the feelings and the thoughts of suicide, but now it's kind of starting to like I'm thinking about it more often. I'm thinking about a little more clearly and that's alarming to me.  Do you want to die? Yeah, I will. Yeah, sometimes sometimes? Um, I mean, you know, sometimes I know, It would be scary to try it and my husband would be so hurt, but at the same time, I want to end this. I want to end the feeling that I'm having depression. Yeah.  Okay. Do you have any plan as to how you would end your life if you decide to do that? I mean, I know if I wanted to that we have pills in the cabinet. So it wouldn't be that hard, I could just take the bottle and  just same pills that you prescribed for depression? Yeah. Do you feel like you're going to carry out that plan? No, I mean, part of it. That's why I'm nervous because like, I'm worried that I might, but at the same time, You know, I'm afraid to so sometimes I think that I might and sometimes I think I won't. I don't want to but sometimes I get scared that I will. Today you're a little worried that you will, or you're a little closer to it then than usual. We've talked about this before in the past, you've come in, you've had kind of that same plan to pills and the thoughts and what what stops you those times was stuck in the past. In the past, I thought, this will get better. I just have to keep trying, I thought what will my husband feel when I'm gone and my family, my parents, my brother and sister I thought that this is as bad as it can get. It has to get better eventually. But now I'm just starting to feel like I don't think it's gonna get better. Alright, so there's times before when you had the same feeling, right? You felt just as bad as you feel now really down hopeless. What happened a few days after that, after the thoughts suicide went away. What was your outlook on life that? I mean, I feel I feel a little better. You know, and then I'd say to myself, that was silly, you know, I don't want to do that. I don't, I don't want to end things. You know. It's It's too rash. But you know, it's starting to feel like a permanent problem. So if you feel like this time these suicidal thoughts are markedly different than what you've experienced before. I wouldn't say markedly but I would say they're different. They're a little they're stronger, more intense? yeah When you think about this, these feelings on before we talked about I know this relationship surrounding relationships, the same thing this time? I mean, I guess that has something to do with it, I guess. It's just like when I look to everything, like everything that could be good or everything, just everything like life, my relationships, the future I just look at it and I see despair. I just see everything going wrong. And I just don't see how it could get better. I just don't see it in a sense of hopelessness? Yes. So this time is different because you feel it's very less situational, less tired of relationships and more, Well, philosophical, you're looking at your outlook and you're saying it's not gonna get any better. What's the point going on? So this is a little bit new territory for you. How long we've been feeling this way with the  intensity right now? Probably a week, maybe a little less What was prevented you from hurting yourself those last week? I'm afraid to do it. I'm just scared. It's like It's like jumping off a diving board. Like you get up to the edge and you stand there, that's where that Have you made any gestures to harm yourself? Like if you went and grabbed the pills or went to the medicine cabinet looks at the pills, anything like that.  Sometimes I look at them, look at them.  Don't think further than look at them? Well, I mean, so I have to take them. It's my prescription. So when it's time I start thinking about it. Like it's more I think about my like, the ideations come even more because it's like a trigger like I'm thinking about the pills. So I go to the cabinet, and I get my pills and I and I take the, the one that I'm supposed to, but I just look at the bottle and I kind of stand there and I just think Instead of putting the bottle back, I could take it with me. And what do you end up doing? It takes a while but I put it back. It's It's scary. Like I look into the bottle and I'm afraid because dying is scary, but  and how about the pain that you would cause husband and the rest of your family? Yeah, I don't want to do that.  You don't want that? I don't. I don't. I don't want my husband to find me, I don't want him to feel like this is his fault. I don't want him to be sad that I'm gone. I don't want him to feel like I feel. And when relatives of somebody that committed suicide, hear about the suicide? Who do they blame?  Yeah. It's not it's not their fault. And I know that they wouldn't be able to get over it and I know that they'll be thinking about how bad I felt they'll have to know what it really felt like for me. So I know this is a tough time right? But the good news is you're here talking to me about it. Right? Now you're talking about it. I'm gonna guess that you want to do something for bad to feel better. Are you gonna carry out your plan or you're gonna hurt yourself? I don't want to are you going to? No, I think I think if I can just remember what it'll be like for them. That'll keep me from doing it. You know, it's the times that I forget to think about how they're going to feel that I get closer to the edge. But when I remember, you know, like, It upsets me to think about what it'll be like for them. So if I can remember to think about that and it'll help me not do that. But I think having the pills there in the cabinet like that is a big temptation for me. Okay, so can we can we do this? Your husband's at home? Right. You mentioned you take two pills once a day? Yeah. Before for bed? Okay. Can we would you be willing to sign a release so I can talk to him. He can hold on to those pills. Just give you the pill each night take one and I will that be okay? Yeah, I think I think that would be a good idea. Is there anything else in the medicine cabinet or anywhere else in the house to give you a danger to? I think, I think yeah, I think it would be a good idea to just make sure that everything that was in the medicine cabinet all the tools? yeah. Would he be willing to do that? Right. Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that he would be willing to do that. He doesn't. He wants me to get through this.  Okay. If I get release for the talk you might , sign it? Yeah. Oh, I'll do that.  Okay. Are you familiar before, are you familiar with this concept we talked about before contracting for safety, or the prior time. So, you've been the state similar to this. Can you promise me that you're going to not hurting yourself. I can Yeah, I can do that. At least until next week when we meet again, I promise. Let's be a little certain that okay, sets up that for a more.  Okay, yeah, we can definitely do that I can do that. I know this is a rough time trying to appreciate how rough it is for you. I want you to keep in mind how you felt after the times before. Now you do tend to pull out of this. And you look back at a lot differently. But in the moment, it's hard to see that. That doesn't necessarily make this any easier. But if you can hang on to we can get through this cycle of depression. You'll probably have a different outlook. If history is any evidence. Does that make sense?  Yeah All right. So what do you have planned for us today? Um, you know, I'm just gonna go home. My husband will be home. work and have dinner, watch TV. So, are you gonna be alone anytime between when you leave here and when you come and see me anymore? Um, yeah, I'll probably be home for a little while in the morning, but I have to work so I won't have, you know, I'll be busy. Okay, if these feelings intensified, or you do feel you're gonna act on them, which promised to call me and kill me call 911  Yeah, I'll do that. Okay. I'm gonna get that release so you can talk to your husband. And then see it for a few minutes or so point for more. All right.

106,"Summarize: Hi Smith How you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm doing all right. How things been since last week? Um, things you know, I've been really sort of preoccupied and anxious a lot this week. My daughter got sick. So I had to take three days off of work to take care of her and I'm starting to worry, she's been sick a lot since I've gone back to work she's in daycare. And I've had to take a lot of time off work and I'm getting close to going over my allotted amount of days. And so I'm finding myself being very anxious about that and then feeling guilty because when I'm trying to take care of her, I'm always worrying about work so,  okay, sounds like a couple things may be going on. In child has been sick so youre taken off days. So there's a little worried about your relationship with your employer. At the same time, you want to make sure you're taking good care of your child having trouble reconciling those two. Yeah. All right. What was the last time it happened, can you described what happened? The last time I had to take off work? Hmm It was just this week. She woke up one morning with a really high fever. So I had to call out that day and then she still had a favourites The next day, and then I had to take a third day because she has to be fever free before she can go back to daycare. So the first day was, I was okay with that. But then like the second and then when I started realizing that I was going to have to take a third day, and I really start to get kind of panicky and were worried about it. Alright, so let me see. Let's go through each day. Right. So the first day when we discovered that she was sick, right well, we Thinking that when you had to call out of work well, because she's been sort of sick a lot lately, I was a little bit worried. And I was sort of, you know, I have this number 10 because I only have 10 days for the whole year. So I had this number in my head and I just thought, Okay, well, there's one more day I got to take away from that 10 that I have, and but I was able to sort of think about, I was a little worried about any work that I would miss, you know, keeping up with my caseload and stuff at work, so, but I was able to kind of figure out that I would be okay for a day and I can kind of make up for that when I get get back. Okay, so you're thinking was this isn't ideal, but I can I can live with it.  Yes Just one, just one day? right How about one on one, day two, when you realize that you're gonna have to take a second day, and I got a little bit more worried and then I did start to also, you know, add the worry of I was going to start to get behind at work. Not only was I missing more time, but I was also going to be behind on my work. So then I started thinking, when I go back, it's going to be a mad scramble and kind of catch up and keep up with everything. And you know, so it was going to became worrying about my workload and worrying about taking more time.  Okay. So a little more stressful version of what happened on day one. And then how about when you discovered that you had to take a third day off? I was then it was just more amplified, you know, amplified worry, and it was a lot harder for me to let it go. I just kept thinking I kept going back to it. And then I started feeling guilty. Because I was so preoccupied worried about that. And I was trying to answer emails and do some stuff and send out some emails to people that I work with to try to help me out with things at work since I wasn't there. And then I felt guilty because I wasn't really caring for my child as best as I felt I should have been, you know, I started feeling kinda like a bad mom. So guilty and a bad mom. And that was mostly on third. That was the worst of it. Yes. Now this go up against the weekend was the third day Friday. All right, so, so then you kind of knew that by Monday, things would be better. So tell me what happened when you returned to work on Monday? Well, I checked in with the main office and you know, I just said I'm really you know, I'm starting to worry I'm getting I know I'm had to take a lot of time. But you know, I've done the best I can to try to make other arrangements but my, you know, just starting back in, starting in daycare, she's just been sick a lot, and I can't control it. I'm doing the best I can. You know, I asked them if there was anything I needed to do as far as providing doctor's notes and stuff. And they said no, that they you know, they don't need a doctor's note since it was my daughter that was sick. They said there's nothing nothing that I really couldn't do and just try to not have it happen much more if I can just do what I can to not miss more. So they said that? Yeah, but yeah. They kind of just said, you know, do what you can do not have it happen, but if it you know if it has to happen, you know, what can I do about it? It was kind of they were saying so, they were understanding? I didn't feel like they were that understanding, but I also didn't feel like they were gonna take any punitive action against me, right, right then and there or anything. Did you anticipate worst reaction than you experienced? Yeah, I did. And I also anticipated that they would maybe have more of a procedure for how to handle it and they didn't have a procedure which also made me feel a little worried. I can't imagine I'm the first mom that has had to deal with this. And they kind of talked like It's never happened before. So I kind of felt anxious, because I thought, am I really the first mom that's had to take a lot of time off because their child sick. They didn't give me the impression that they had sort of a protocol or like they had dealt with this before. As a sort of like it took them by surprise? Yeah, or they just didn't have a plan for what to do about it. And they were investing a lot of energy in thinking about that? No, no, I guess not. And when was the second how long? Just this past week, this week. So how has this week been back at work? Oh, it's been very busy because I'm trying to catch up and get everything handled. But that's the way it always, always is. So nobody has said anything to me or anything about the absences  other than that first and other ? Yeah. And there's been no more absences? Nope Okay, earlier you mentioned being a good mom How a good mom look lik? Umm somebody who takes care of their child and puts them makes them a priority, like their first priority. And, you know, does the things that they need to do to make sure their child is taken care of. And you're a little worried through this was last experience you're talking about that you didn't rise level of good mom? Yeah, I felt like I wasn't being a good mom because I was preoccupied and making work a bit of a bigger priority than taking care of my kid. Okay, so so good, mom's more about More than just rather, your behavior, right, what you're doing is about what you're also thinking. So you took care of your child.  Yeah. But your mind, your thoughts are somewhere else some of the time. And that's where you feel like you've, you've wandered out of the good mom area. Okay, I've been on the other side, how about a good employee? Did you mention that? You want to be a good employee?  Yeah. What's what's that look like? Um, well, somebody that, you know, takes care of all of their workload and handles all of the tasks that they have each day and someone that's consistent and reliable, and, you know, puts effort into what they're doing and gets their job done. Really, you know, reliably. And that's where you feel like with the sort of the last workdays you missed. You missed three. Okay, how about last year? How many days have you missed? Well, I missed a lot for maternity leave. So that's understandable but excluding that? I've missed out since the school year started, I've missed if you include the three. I've missed nine days. But some of those were half days. They add up to nine days.  Okay, total nine? Yeah. And you're allowed? 10 per school year, it's only January and I'm already at nine. I can see that will cause worry what happens if you go over the 10 I don't know. I mean, I think that they would dock my pay for the for those for it. If I was there a day and I didn't have any more sick days left. They would just dock my pay for that day. But outside of that, I don't know what else would happen. Is anybody that you work with that you could ask that question to HR department? Yeah, I guess I could contact the HR department. I'm just thinking because you're just one day away, from being at that number might be prudent just to talk with them and see. See, you know what to expect, right? So this whole thing though, the missing days caused you anxiety, frustration. Yeah, a little bit about any type of feeling down at all? A little bit sometimes when I start feeling like I'm a bad mom. Okay, so that so as far as your child is concerned in your relationship with your child, yes, some anxiety relationship at work, some anxiety, but the sadness mostly surrounds how you feel you're treating your job. Of all the emotions of frustration, anxiety, what I'll refer to as depression I should say sadness. What's bothering you the most? What? emotional response is probably the most? probably sort of the guilt and the feelings of not being able to be the best mom. How would you rate yourself right now as a mother if say 10 was the best mother you could imagine? Right? And one was the absolute worst? I'm probably like an eight. Okay. That's pretty good, right?  Yeah. What would be the cutoff to where? What's the cutoff score? And that will scale I just gave it for good mother and not good mother. I guess like halfway like,  so five is good enough. Yeah, feel like It's not good enough for me.  Okay. Okay I wouldn't be okay with that. So if you look at somebody else, another person in similar situation of five would be acceptable. Right?  Probably. Yeah. But how about for you specifically? Yeah, that's not  that's not gonna cut it? Yeah Well, we've cut it.  I don't know. At least a seven. and you're an eight Yeah sure? No not sure. Okay. So you're close to the border. Like you're close to the border on you're your value system of being not a good mother. Yes, not as good a mother as I want to be Okay. Now, what do you want to be? Yeah, I want to be like a eight or higher, eight or higher where you are in s you said? Yeah okay. So you want to be the parent sounds like Well, yeah, doesn't everybody want to be the best at what they do? I mean, I think people are driven to, to do their best. But is it crucial to be perfectly crucial to be a 10? No, there's some leeway, I guess you have to allow for that. Remember before in other sessions for the situations you've brought in here, we've talked about dysfunctional thinking, irrational thinking. How does reflect on that, like the usefulness of of these thoughts? The, you know, the other mothers can be a five and B. And that's, that's good, right? You need to be an eight or hire a nine or 10 , does it seem useful, like a useful way of thinking? In some ways, it's useful because it keeps me keeps me on track if that makes sense. It keeps me pushing to keep doing the best I can. Okay, So it does have a useful side does have an unusual side less than useful? Well, yeah, I guess it does in the sense that if I become too worried about it, then I'm wasting energy on worry instead of being able to put that energy into being good mom. Yeah. So I guess one things I'm getting at here is has to worry has the anxiety or it paid off for you? Probably not. Why not? So you're suffering with it? Yeah it might make you a little more vigilant but mostly most, it's just causing suffering. Yeah. So at the heart of it, you're not a bad mom. Right? You're in good mom category. You're a good employee. Right. But your, your way of dying yourself, Your perception is that you're not doing a great job at either one. Exactly. And that's the thinking I'm getting that it's not, you know, it's not necessarily irrational. I'm thinking it's just less than useful. It's dysfunctional. Yeah, I can see that. Yeah, we're talking about that third day, right. The the third day of work you had to you had to call off. And do you remember any specific thoughts that are going through your mind on that? What was that a morning when you figured it out? Like a Friday morning? Yeah. Um, no, it was really the night But, um, well, you know, I went as far as to think, am I gonna get fired? You know, I had to kind of think about so your thought was, am I gonna get fired?  Yeah. And then what was the feeling that that came right after that? panic and worry Oh, yeah,  maybe some anxiety? some anxiety? Yeah. Were you able to do anything to address that panic or your anxiety at that time? Like, did you tell yourself anything? Or did you take some action? Oh, I did tell myself that I didn't go over yet. And, you know, hopefully I won't, you know, there's still a chance that I'm not going to go over on my days and hopefully won't go so far as to fire me, you know, and how did you feel after you  consciously had that thought? a little bit better, but the still kept hovering around. Yeah the whole time. Probably all the way till Monday, right when you returned to work? Yeah. Yeah. Like I wanted to call somebody at work and talk to them about it and make sure it was okay. But you know, it was the weekend, so I couldn't do any of those things. I just had to wait it out. Yeah. So we've talked before about self talk, you might remember me saying the phrase adaptive response, right? So it's the kind of pre packaged response we have two thoughts that we've identified is not so useful.  Right. So degree, those thoughts like, Am I going to get fired and all that? Not very useful in that moment?  Yes. not useful in that moment understandable. Right, but not useful. yeah So what's you had sort of some self talk that you apply on your own, what some other self talk with some other another thought that you could think or something you can say yourself that could counter an automatic thought like that. Like, specifically, I'm gonna lose my job. Well, I guess I could say, you know, I didn't, you know, I'm not. I haven't had any conversations with anybody that have indicated that. So sort of like maybe I just need to not worry about it or cross that bridge when I come to it kind of thing. Like, hopefully it won't. I don't know if it will happen or not. And hopefully it won't happen. So, so there the self talk there is there's no clear indication that's gonna happen,  right So why borrow the worry? Right? How about other habit adaptive behaviors? We talked about the importance of support systems before other sessions. Is there anybody else that could watch your child if you were really running up against that? Yeah, my mom can. can sometimes I did call her this this week to see if she could take one of take a day. But she couldn't because of what she had going On, but in in other times she might be able to take a day and stay home or my sister can do that as well. And my husband can sometimes it depends on what is going on that week for him at work. So there are some options there. Did you explore those options for this last time? I did. I did, but just the circumstances didn't work out.  So none of those individuals were available? right. Is there any other options you have for care? Was that it? That's really it. You know, when she's sick, and that's really it, because you don't i don't want to put her around any other kids, which is why I wouldn't send her to daycare. So that seems reasonable. Okay, so there are some things you've already done. Right. And I think at this point, since to address I know this is the lesser of your worries, which is your employer, you're more worried about being a good mom, but to go look at the employer side first. Second, you can talk to HR, you can try to understand what the consequences are for going over explained that doesn't appear to be your fault.  Right. Okay. And I don't know what you can do in terms of support, maybe try to get a better awareness of the schedules when they're available and or convey the nature of your problem to them. Customer Support  Yeah. So that was one issue. Now if you highlight more prominently though, the good mother want to touch on that as well. You did everything you had to do to care for your child? Yes, Are you sure? Yeah,  okay hundred percent ? Except for my my thinking I was maybe a little not as present as I should have been. Okay. And we'll get to that but your behavior behavior. Yeah, you did everything a good mom would do. Yeah. Okay. So is it okay? If you're doing everything you need to do to think thoughts that don't seem congruent with that, you know, the distract you away from that? I guess it's not ideal, but it's okay. It's not ideal. So you'd really rather be have the ability to be really focused on what's going on your child to the exclusion of what's going on other circumstances? you know, or at least be able to put my worry about the other circumstances aside for the time for that time period. So by addressing the employer issue, that might give you a little relief one good mom ish. All right. So here's another opportunity to talk about dysfunctional thoughts. I think that is reflect on whether you're a good mom or not, you're really basing it on this idea that if I'm thinking about something other than my child, I'm in the wrong place in terms of being a good mom. Are you only being distracted? Right so that pushes you on a one to 10 scale? Yeah the more thoughts you have like that you think of it as like pushing you down toward five. Yeah. Okay. So when you have those thoughts what's an adaptive response or you know, self talk, what can you tell yourself in those moments? that I'm doing them behaving doing the behaviors that I need to do and the baby doesn't know what I'm thinking so probably not. She doesn't know what I'm distracted or worried. So I'm not doing any harm to her. Who doesn't know you're distracted or worried? I guess just me. Just you? Yeah. So the self talk that would be I'm doing what I have to do to be a good mom. And that's what my child says. Right right. But I have these understandable thoughts that come in where I worry about other things and more or less justice what it is, right? I mean, you're permitted to worry about things life isn't going to be worryfree true. But we can, we can work to not suffer more than we have to  right That kind of makes sense? Yeah. It makes sense. And, you know, when you say it back to me the things that I'm saying it does sound a little bit irrational, or unhelpful less than useful.  Yeah, it's a little less than useful it's not, you know, I want this important distinction. It's not good or bad right. And those words have a function right in our in our lives, but they're a little dangerous when applied in terms of mental health when they're applied to things like you know, good mom, bad mom.  Right But doesn't leave a lot of gray area to talk about. improvement. Right? Also, it seems like what you're describing your, your way into the good mom category anyway. Sure. 8 or 10 I think most people would be happy with an eight out of 10.  TRUE So it's not like you've drifted down toward five before somewhere. Okay. So there's a couple different Yeah, I know we talked about two different subjects, right, but they're related the work situation and situation care for a child. But those are some self talk strategies. So I'd like you to do when you go home today, and I would I would ask you to do it today if you can. Okay, I think it's important in the states in terms of time, near when we're having this conversation. If you could try to document some of those automatic thoughts. Remember, I gave you a worksheet before and then work on some of your own calm adaptive response.  Okay okay. Maybe around this area or maybe about other areas as well, it doesn't. It's okay. If you have other problems you'd want to apply the model to, but certainly around this issue of the childcare versus the work performance. That's the real struggle that's going on right now inside of you. Is that right? Yes. Yes. Do you think you'd be able to have that completed? next week? yeah, I think I can handle that. Yeah. Okay. So we'll leave it there and I'll see you next week. Okay, thank you.  Thanks, ma'am.","Patient is sort of preoccupied and anxious this week.

107,"Summarize: Hey Jill, how are you doing today? I am All right, I'm a little bit stressed out right now.  Little stressed, What's going on? Well, as you know, I'm in a graduate program right now. And I'm just really coming to the near the end of my program and I'm just finding it increasingly difficult. I'm just really stressed with how things have been going.  Okay, we've talked about some different struggles you've had as you balance work and school and everything. What specifically is bothering now it seems like you're a little more distressed today. Well, I don't I don't, I don't really know. It's just I am, as I've told you, before, I take school really seriously and I really strive to do well, well in school and well on my assignments and I just feel like I'm not performing, as well as I needed to what kind of grades you've been getting lately? Well, I've been getting A's, anything else? No Okay. That's usually considered pretty good, right? Yeah. I just feel like it's getting harder to get the As okay, you're working hard to get the same grade? right, It used to be so easy for me to do what my teachers expect and to get good grades. Now I feel like it's, it's really a struggle and I'm not doing as well as I need to and I'm constantly worried about not doing this well. Have you been getting any feedback from professors or your classmates about your performance? My teachers all seem to think I'm doing well. They actually I see To get good feedback on my assignments, but I feel like I feel like I just to make sure I'm doing well. I really focus on like the details like making sure that the instructions are really clear, like I'm doing everything, like perfectly as an Instructure instructor wants because I'm really afraid that you know, if I'm not really clear on what the assignment is, then maybe I won't do it the right way.  Alright, so before when you got A's you were working hard to have a job but not to the level of precision in terms of like the detail in the assignment that you are now. You're trying to get more information about the assignments, you're working harder to get the same grade that used to get before right like I find myself like emailing the teacher like almost like obsessively, like trying to, to clarify the assignment and to make sure do they think I'm doing well in class and and what not. So when you're when you're having this feeling that I guess it's a feeling of anxiety or stress, yeah. What's going through your mind? What are you thinking about? Well, I guess I'm just feeling that, you know, I've worked really hard, this whole program and I don't want to mess it up now or, you know, because if I don't get these grades, and I feel like what was the use, if I met, then I'm going to be ruining all this hard work, that I've done this whole program if I kind of, if I don't maintain that level of, you know, like you said, precision, I feel like like that I've let myself down or that I'm a failure because I'm, I just slacked off at the end of the program and it's so close to being done. So what grade would you have to receive for you to feel like you have failed probably less than an A. Anything other than A right below an A isn't A minus? I mean, I guess I would be okay with that, but I wouldn't be really happy with it.  What about A plus? I wouldn't be that excited about that. a B? I wouldn't be happy with that. No, no, it'd be worse. Okay. So an A you can tolerate an A minus you're not exactly sure but you think you could yeah. But a B plus and a B? to me like, like an A minus I would maybe be okay with but like, below that like to me like a B, whether it's like a B minus A B, A, B plus it's all B, and that's not an so what would it mean to you if you received a B? that I didn't try hard enough, but there's something else I could have done to to do better that I was like, slacking or I didn't read the directions right or I didn't have enough responses or make my paper long enough. I just didn't do enough.  But you didn't try hard enough that you didn't do enough. What would it mean If that were true? If I didn't try hard enough that I was lazy. That you were lazy? Yeah, that I could have tried harder and I didn't. So why didn't I try? I didn't, maybe I didn't care. I was lazy. Kind of like what's the use? If you're not gonna try your best and why try it all? Okay, now we we've talked before about automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions right in other sessions and one of the cognitive distortions is this idea that unuseful type of thinking and Aaron thinking is when you think of everything in terms of like, Black or White, all or nothing? So sounds like you have a little tolerance for like an A minus you're not completely there. But generally, it's kind of an A of some type, right? Or you're not interested. Right. So we get down to you didn't try hard enough and if that were true, the new would be lazy. Right? Which, you know, having senior these last few sessions is clear to me. You're not lazy. But that's the body. Yes. Now, it seems that earlier in your earlier years in the program, this was the Acer effortless for you, but you'd have to work as hard for them.  Yeah what's what do you think has changed? I'm not quite sure. Like it didn't stress me out as much in the beginning of the program. Like I really like school. But now I feel like I'm static because it's anxiety producing for me because, you know, I'm constantly worried You mentioned part of it was you can get close to the end, right. So is there anything else? Well, the only thing I can think of is we have the same students throughout our program. But I guess this semester there's a new student in the program and I know that you mentioned and it seems like she's kind of really stressing me out. And also well see throughout the program, I kind of considered myself like to be the student who got the best grades and there's this award at the end of the program for doing really well. And I kind of made it a goal of mine to get this award at the end because I felt like that would show that I really tried hard this program really meant a lot to me. I think You know, it would show people who viewed Did that, you know, I really busted my butt and, and did a good job in this program. And for the whole program so far, you know, that was me like that was I was kind of the front runner, I guess for this award. And this semester, there's a new student and then come to find out like she had a 4.0 in her other program. So, so if I'm reading you, right, you you really didn't have any competition for this award that you were aware of. Right? And now you feel like you really do, right like I feel like the pressures on like, I felt like I tried so hard, this whole program and now like this new person comes in, and she might want a different me so I really need to go above and beyond to make sure that I'm still on track. I'm paradoxically that's caused you to be more anxious and more stressed and your performing but you're still getting the A's which are working harder to get the A's, right. And it's causing me a lot of anxiety with school where it's not as enjoyable for me as it once was. So what would it mean if you couldn't get the award if you didn't with the, what's the name of the new was first name with a new choice choice? Okay, but of choice once award, and you didn't want me? I guess part of me feels like them. Why did I do the program? if, you know, part of me feels like if you're not going to be the best why try? So if, if she got the award over me, then it's kind of like, why did I work so hard this whole time, like I could have been slacking this whole time and just skated by so why did I bust my butt? If it was all for nothing? I don't have anything to show for it.  So its all or nothing if you don't win the award. I mean, I guess it's not the only thing that matters so part of me feels that way sometimes that I have these thoughts that if I don't try my hardest and do well and win this award, then why do I try so hard the rest of the time, but like it negates all the positive things. This that this, you know, kind of like the end result like if you tried hard the whole race and then you lose, you know, at the end. Right, but you're not really losing a race because you would still graduate? Yeah. You're you're just not getting a word, which you would like, right and which would be great. Right, and certainly accomplishment. But the reason you came to the program was to get the degree, right and even know about the award until probably like the second year anyway, so that wasn't the reason I entered. But, but it's now it's now taken on some importance for you winning award has been a real goal. Yeah. So with the new student choice coming in, I have this increased competition.  Right. And that's causing me anxiety is caused you to work hard for the same grade. All right. So, as we talked before, you have a tendency to be, I mean, this as a compliment a little perfectionistic. Right. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. It is taking too far, It can be right it can be not useful. Ever hear the phrase Perfect is the enemy of good. No. Does that make sense what that might mean?  Yeah. Yeah. So this desire to be perfect or to win the award is potentially causing you not even to perform well. Right? Right you're still getting the A's but it's called the anxiety and you're working hard and right now I'm not even I feel like when I read, like, I'm so stressed with it from reading the right thing and memorizing every word that I'm not retaining all the information, so it could and it's starting to like impact school. So is there any way that you cannot win the award and still walk away? having accomplished worthy goals? Or does it have to be the award or none of this was worth it? I mean, it kind of sounds silly when you when you're reflecting it back to me how, you know that I have to read the words like I, I think that it makes sense. You know, that wasn't my goal going into it. You know, why does it matter so much to me that there's different degrees of success. I think if you've said before that is Not all about the award, I think I would be happy with just, you know, getting the degree and all the stuff that I've learned. And I would feel like it was, if I didn't get the award rather, I would feel like it was still a worthwhile journey. But in the moment, sometimes it's really upsetting at the thought of not getting the award. But that's a possibility.  Your word validates all the hard work you've done. Right, exactly.  And in your mind, losing the award invalidates all the hard work you've done, right? But in reality, there's probably a between ground there might have been a shade of gray, where you're still an excellent student, you still graduate, you just don't have an extra plaque hanging on the wall, whatever the word is, right. That's really all you'd be missing. Right? yep With this award have any impact on employment? I don't think so I am thinking about I don't think of a long term many people would know about it besides me, or if I put it, you know, on a resume or something, but I don't think it would make that much of a difference. And you didn't know about it when you first came in, and you're already working hard. right at the beginning, I didn't even know about it. So in a sense, and of course, we can't do this, for the sense of you could forget about the award. Right? You probably win it. Right, Right. Because you're already doing so well. But the thought of this potential failure, right away the word that's holding you back, right, It makes me it makes me paranoid to make mistakes or to try and take risks or to really, you know, do well because I'm so worried about judgment, like from my teachers, if I'm doing well enough.  Yeah, there's no there's no tolerance for any type of mistake? Right. Right. So so now that with the award out there, you really feel like you can't make any type of mistake or you just go right to, to a catastrophe? Right, like I'm walking on eggshells, and I'm just expecting my grades to tank if I if I kind of like deviate from that line. So free so for you to feel better about this one way, I guess right would be to not help have to not place so much value in way. It's really hard. Yeah, you really want that. And it would be great. And that's okay. Right? We talked about the adaptive responses before, right? What are what's your automatic thought you have when you're sitting there and trying to get every assignment right and you you're kind of vaguely thinking about not losing or not winning this award was the automatic thought that comes to mind? if I'm you If I want when I'm just doing the work, yeah, when you're doing your work, and you sense that anxiety come on, right as you start maybe vaguely thinking about winning or losing this award, right? Like it's losing it Really? What's going through your mind right that moment? I guess I'm just kind of like running through a checklist. Did I do this? Did I do this? Did I do this? Making sure I did everything that was expected of me to ensure that you're gonna get that award? Right. Right. So at a higher level, one of your thoughts is, I must win that award.  Right. Does that make sense? I mean, that that's probably somewhere. Is there any type of adaptive response you could apply that moment, that statement, or kind of, well, that's an absolute statement, right? I must win that award. Is there any type of adaptive response you could play at that moment that could counteract that on thought That  I must win the award? Yeah. I guess I could say that, you know, this, the award is something local to my university and no one's going to know about it in the grand scheme of things. So it won't really impact future employment or what my colleagues think of me. You know, if I, if I don't get the award that they won't think less of me. Okay, so so you could say, it'd be nice to win the award. But in the end, it's not really gonna make the difference in my life in terms of my career right. and, and that's a fair, adaptive response, right? You do want to win it, right? Truthfully, and it would be nice to win it right. Who doesn't want to win the award, right? But if you don't, you were still good student. You're still gonna be a good connection and your career still good before. Do you believe in that adaptive response? Do you believe that adaptive response is true? I feel like sometimes I do. And then sometimes it's really hard in the heat of the moment to kind of talk myself down from that, that kind of spiral of not doing this assignment, right? I'm not doing well. I'm going to get to be in this class, I'm going to lose this award. So I feel like it starts. It's hard in the moment to spiral out of that. So what percentage of the time Do you believe that adaptive response is true? Maybe like half the time, so 50% of time? right? depends on what's going on in my stress. And the other half, you're not really buying.  Right Okay. All right. So what advice Well, let's use choice, right? choices in the same situation, in a sense, in that she's, well, maybe not knowing what she is working toward this award as well I don't even know she knows about the award. Let's assume. Let's assume she knows about it. Right? He's in a similar situation. What advice would you give her?  She's kind of obsessing about this in the same way that you are. Yeah. I think I would tell her that, you know, the rest of the class sees that she's doing well. Her teachers give her positive feedback. So all science would point towards that you're doing really well and you're being very successful in the program that you're getting positive feedback from them. So that all the signs the feedback is telling you you're doing a really good job. Your advice to her seems positive and uplifting. Mostly, your advice to her is more positive, uplifting what you're telling yourself internally, definitely it is. So if that advices adequate. I feel It is adequate and appropriate for her. Why isn't it adequate probably for you? I don't know sometimes I feel like I just hold myself to a higher standard than I hold other people to like if some a friend of mine like Joyce would come and tell me the same situation, you know, I'd be able to give her a whole bunch of, you know, suggestions or some positive feedback, but it's really hard for me sometimes because I hold myself to a higher standard than other people. But you would agree your advice to choice as you frame it to me is useful, right? But you're just having trouble applying that to yourself? Yes. Smooth. That's what you need to work on a bit. So you can kind of see the logic of all this, but your feelings don't match. Correct. Makes sense in my head and I would know what to tell someone else but I don't always believe it. When I say to myself, Alright, so here's what I want you to do. You familiar with the thought record that I introduced you in the first session where you can outline your situation and your feelings and you've explained all this to me, I want you to actually complete one thought records.  Okay I know after having set it all might seem like doubling the work. But I think it's something changes when you write something down. Okay, I have to face it on paper. And also, it's a good tool to remember exactly what you're thinking. And then work through the adaptive response section and their smiles at the bottom of thought record questions you can ask yourself to help you form that adaptive response. And maybe write out a few different ones. But there's plenty of room on the forum. You see it, right,  right. That's actually the largest grid cell is the one on adaptive responses, that the responses don't have to be short. like yours wasn't short. There's really good they can they can be long and they can So be realistic, like, I'd like to win. It would be good to win. But Alice should have to be successful.  Okay I thinl  the adaptive response kicked out is to the downside of not having success, okay? It doesn't have to be completely positive. Okay, has to be realistic and useful. And, as importantly, you have to believe it. Okay, there's a place on there to note what percentage you believe that you could write that in. Okay, I know we'll look at that from week to week and, you know, as we move closer to your graduation, hopefully it'll bring you some relief for missing anxiety.   Okay that's sounds like a good plan? Hmm Thanks. Thanks.","Patient a little bit stressed out right now. as patient in a graduate program right now. And patient just really coming to the near the end of program and patient just finding it increasingly difficult.Therapist talked about some different struggles patient had as patient balance work and school and everything. Patient feel like getting harder. Patient feels like struggle to get good grades.Patient slacked off at the end. Patient things that he gets less than A but patient is not happy with less than A.  Patient thinks that he can do better and feels like lazy aand thinks that patient could have tried harder.  Therapist explains about automatic thoughts and cognitive distortion in  other session. Patient constantly worried. Patient feels like she's stressing me out. Patient things that he is slacking for whole time and just skated. Patient try hard rest of the time and negates all the positive things. Therapist explained that anxiety is caused to work hard for the same grade and says the phrase perfect is enemy of good.  and desire to be perfect or to win the award is potentially causing not even to perform well. and its called anxiety .Patient is stressed when reading and memorizing.Therapist said losing the award invalidates patients hard work. Patient becaome paranoid to make mistake or to try take risks.Therapist suggest apdaptive response before, right whats your automatic thought and patient feeling kind of vaguly thinking about not losing or not winning this award was the automatic thought.Therapist tells that patient is good student and gonna be good connection and your career still good before.Patient would tell her that she was really good. Therapist said she is  positive and uplifting and more positive."
108,"Summarize: Yeah, okay. All right. What was your relationship with your teachers? And maybe those that some of the peers that you had at the school? I mean, was there any? No, I usually I've been dealing with the teachers. Honestly, I was always the class clown. So I'm usually getting kicked out, getting detention, you know, so I didn't really get along with the teachers trying to teach class right stuff.  Okay. So overall today are you pursuing or do you want to further your education Yeah, I'm trying to get in college. Right. Yeah. Great. So you're looking into for year junior college, yeah, a dream college. And what would be like, give me a little bit during the time that you were in school. Did you have a job heavy work? I was working at cost wise, It's a restaurant Through the school, okay, and it was not like a job program, right, package of knives and forks and wrapped in salt and pepper and would send them over to the school. I mean to the restaurant.  You sent over to the restaurant. Yeah. Okay. So you would prep everything, you know, all the tensile Ready?  Yeah Okay. Now, when you were working, how did that make you feel when you're working? You know, I got boring at times, obviously And because the Patriots were also really small.  but it was the start? Yeah, it was a start.  Right. And so how did it make you feel good? Because you work for something And then the finished product was your paycheck. Yeah. So if you want something in life, you pretty much have to work for it work for a car or not You have to work at a young age. How old were you when you started working? 10 years old 10 years old and then you started working and As a program for the school, so you know, you've known at a young age that it's going to take hard work, yeah to achieve something to achieve something. Now, what about your dream job? What would be if tomorrow you could say, I'm gonna have this person tomorrow? Or this is my profession tomorrow? What would be your dream job?  A pilot Wow.  And when what was what's your reasoning behind that? I love airplanes I used to make smaller airplane Tell me more about that. What would you do in your dream job? I just want to fly by being in the end, I like going fast. Fast in the air and being above Yeah, I think being able to see different view. So pilot Have you looked into what it would take to become a pilot. You know, the only struggle with thatI dont have to drink, I don't think this will work out What is you next dream job? A cop. Police Officer, have you looked into that what it takes? yeah trying to get back into this cadet program I was doing for about three weeks ago was doing it but was too far. So to kind of really go forward in my area right maybe that's something we can discuss to help you find the cadet program close fine. We're able to give you a, you know, some goals to set to get you in the program at that. But let's look at you know, back, let's back up a little bit to the marijuana. Because you and I know being in law enforcement, you know, marijuana and being a cop, pretty much  Yeah, yeah.  And you would have to what would you have to do? Let it go, I have to let it go.  So, what we want to do while you're here, you know, we want to help you here develop a treatment plan and treatment model where you can pursue some realistic goals. We want to set some goals for you. Also, what about your medical History? tell me a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been in the hospital? Has anything ever happened to a broken bone I had surgery on my cybereason What about in your family? Is there any diseases in your family and you want to know suffer for any illnesses, ailments. Okay. And as far as medical attention is there anyone that needs medical that needed medical attention in the past maybe someone on meds in your family psychological health? Was there anyone maybe that has gone to therapy that has been in therapy Your family and family member No. And what we want to do, what I want to do to help you with this verse is one want to develop a treatment plan to help you with the marijuana use. We want to be able to look at your support system, you know who's in your life right now? What are your friends that you smoke marijuana with? What type of people are they? Would this be a good fit for you? But our whole goal is to start you off with small steps. `So today, you're using marijuana how many times a day. So you pretty much said you use it every day. 
 Yeah. But how many times? 3-4 times when do you wake up and what you do? yeah. It's not my morning routine. Go ahead and do it. And then usually around noon time I'll do it again and then towards five o'clock. I'll do it again at nighttime in Fargo. They'll do Again, right so one of maybe one of the realistic goals is you're okay you know we can we can narrow down maybe the relationship see which of your friends right now today? How many of them smoke about six seven Yeah so maybe a realistic short term goal is to begin to see which friends to hang out with you know and then also your mom man either way she She told me before you fall into the wrong crowd and fall into something just she pretty much said that this if I keep this up is gonna get me into something I don't want to get into right now jail time round because we makes you do things that you shouldn't be doing for other things legal, right so, so definitely we want to look at your whole peer relationships who your friends are We also want to look at your your time right now. So, you mentioned earlier that you were working. Are you working today?  No. Okay, so maybe that's another thing a realistic goal that we need to look at, and maybe help you pursue is it as a job? Maybe because the idle time sometimes can trigger events, you know, where you begin to want to use marijuana, and then we can identify some of the emotions that you're feeling. Let's go over that maybe briefly. Before you get before you smoke marijuana, is there a feeling that you have that says, hey, you depress, so we can look at the depression and see how we can treat that. What else? What are some of the other feelings that you see? so angry, You know what you think? Be a bit boring, but my girlfriend So it's kind of a start. So it still bothers me as much as I'm trying to ignore it. Instead, it still bothers me.  Right? There's a certain days that maybe perhaps you remember or events Like Thanksgiving and Christmas and holidays and things like that. That's when you become angry. Yes. How you were brought up? Yeah its like that I don't appreciate my foster parents. Right? But just with Billy, I've been born with my biological right. So we want to maybe will equip you with some coping skills, how to cope with those things, how to prepare you maybe for the holidays, maybe there's a way we can, you know, we can begin to look at that. During the holidays. This is these are the emotions I feel. So we identify those emotions and we'll be able to, you know, take care of that we'll be able to prepare you prior to you are you falling back into the trap of going out and using marijuana Maybe during Christmas? Do you feel the same way during Christmas? Yeah Maybe even your birthday, Father's Day, Mother's Day, these are all things that we can kind of get you ready for. Because once again, it's gonna take small steps, realistic goals. And then what we want to do after that the real estate goals is just get you ready, you know, for long term goal. But you know what, Curtis? I'm glad you came into my office. It was great meeting you. I look forward to working with you.  All right. Is there any other questions that you may have for me? Is there anything? How many times a week Am I going to be allowed to come? What Well, we can do we'll set you up with a treatment plan. And then I'd like to meet at least have two contacts with you your week. We can go over that. And then maybe during one of the context, we can help you with one, help you with a job. Okay? And then identifying some of the emotions. And then maybe we can get the whole marijuana use, we can begin to kind of taper it down instead of seven, you know, everyday. Yeah, we'll begin to see how we can take with that. Okay, we're down but again, I'm glad that you came. It was a pleasure meeting you and we'll be in touch and we'll be able to do it again. Okay. All right.","Patient was dealing with the teachers. Patient was always the class clown, getting kicked out and detention. Patient can't really get along with the teachers.

109,"Summarize: Hello, Judy Thomas.  Yes. Hi. Hello there. My name is Dr. Beji. I'm one of the new GP in the practice. And I'm seeing you today instead of Dr. Jones, who's your usual GP? Yes, he is. Yeah.  First of all, what would you like me to call you?  Oh, Julie os fine.  Okay. Okay. But Julie, so what is it that's bought you to see me today? Well, it's the same thing that I see Dr. Jones about as my heart.  Yeah, I understand that you've been in to see him a few times over the last few months. Would you mind if I asked you to go over again what the problem is perhaps in your own words, so that I get an understanding of it.  I just I keep getting these situations where my heart starts to really, really race like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I get chest pains. I can't catch my breath and it's making me feel funny talking to you about And so my heart starts to race. I can't get my breath and I get chest pain. I  get very afraid. I'm gonna have to die and you're feeling a little bit anxious just here with me. Yeah I am just talking about it. I can feel it starting to come up. Take your time. Okay. So your heart starts to race really beats really fast and you feel like you can't catch your breath. Yeah, that's exactly it. Yes. Yeah. How long has all this been going on for Julie? I think it's probably about six months, basically.  Okay. And can you remember what happened to start it all off? Well, I think we have had some problems at work. And I felt more stressed about work than I normally do. And basically, I was just trying to get into town one day on a day off and it was very hot, very funny, hot days and it just happened. My heart just started. to race and race and race and I couldn't get my breath, I was just like gasping for breath. Then I start to get chest pains and it was just awful. And I managed to sit down and call my husband and he, he came out, he actually left work to come and get me.  Right. So that sounds like quite an unpleasant experience. Its was awful It frightenining, yeah and when that was happening to Julie, when you're in the middle of town, what was it that you thought was going on?  I thought I was having a heart attack I'm so afraid that that's is what's happening. Right Okay. So you know, start to try to avoid situations where I might get like that they see ya.  So what kind of things are you finding yourself avoiding? I can't get into town now without my husband taking me My husband has to take me to from work. And then I also thought I shouldn't do anything to put any strain on my heart at all. So I don't do much exercise or anything at the moment or other things as well and other things, what sort of things you are not doing? personal things, personal things.  Okay. I guess I'm wondering if you're talking about your sex life there. Yeah. Right. Now I just feel, you know that I shouldn't do anything like that, because it just might put too much strain on me. So you're avoiding sex in case that puts your heart rate up. yeah yeah Okay, How's that affecting things between you and your husband? My husband's getting really fed up with it to be honest. He's been really, really kind and really supportive. But I think it's starting to affect his life quite a lot now. So he wanted me to go to the pub last week and absolutely promised that I would, because I've begun to stop wanting to go out because I'm so afraid it's gonna happen. I promised and promised him I go to the pub. And then when it came to it, I just couldn't. I just sat on the sofa and it started happening again. And then I was worried that if I went to the pub, I'd actually like get ill in the pub. And then it's really embarrassing for everybody. So just that I couldn't go in, and I think he's getting a bit To the end of his tetanus because it just seems to come out of the blue. And I've never suffered from anything like this before. It sounds like he's getting to the end of his tether because it also sounds like you're pretty fed up with the whole thing as well. Julie Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah.  So just so that I've got the story straight. This all began about six months ago. Before that, had you had anything like this?  No, not at all. I mean, I think we had a new manager at work, I work in a bank only and then we had a new computer system put in and so it became very much stressful for all the staff not just me. And that's I can sort of see that I was in a lot more pressure and that could be affecting me. So just to make sure I've got the right the right way around. It began six months ago, pressure at work went to town you had the first of these attacks. And then since then you've had some more and now it's kind of got to the point that you don't want to go out to don't get to town by yourself.  No, I don't want to risk it to be honest.  You know, you don't go to the pub, not socializing like you used to and you avoiding things like exercise and things like sex and having a bit of a taking its toll on your relationship.  Yeah yeah yeah. Okay. Okay. And looking at your I know, you've had an ECG, Dr. Jones, organized for you a couple of months ago.  Yeah What have you been told about the results of that? Well Dr. Jones said that it was okay. And there were no problems. And, you know, I did feel relief, you know, because, obviously, there's been events in my family, my dad died of one, you know, 72. So I'm thinking it must be my heart. There must be something wrong with it right now. It did feel pleased when Dr. Jones said that. But on the other hand, nothing's changed. You know, I'm still getting exactly the same problems. Nothing, you know, not getting any help with it. I just feel a bit like well, so I haven't got a bad heart according to the experts, but I'm still getting all the same symptoms you kow worse and worse. So even though the your GP told you there's no, there's nothing to worry about with your heart. Do you still worry that There might be something wrong with your heart? I can't understand it. What do you think of Dr. Julia? I think I agree with Dr. Jones. I don't think there is anything wrong with your heart. The reason I say that is that you've had an ECG, which has come back perfectly normal. And usually if there was a problem with the heart the ECG would pick something up. Also, you've got none of the risk factors really for heart disease, because you you don't smoke, your blood pressure, from what I can gather from you notes has always been fine. You're fairly young. Before this, you were pretty fit and active. And also, I know you're worried about your dad having had a heart attack, but actually, he was a lot older than you are. And so you're not really in the same risk sort of bracket as he would have been.  Right. So I don't think that there is a problem with your heart. I guess what I'm what Is weather actually, what's going on is a little bit more what Dr. Jones thought weather actually this, this might be the anxiety that's giving you a lot of these symptoms. Have you ever thought it might be that rather than a heart problem? I think I've been thinking more recently, it could be because my friend has like panic attacks. I've discussed it with her and she said, to be honest, it just sounds like that. I've always thought it was my heart. And what I can't understand is how my brain is making my heart start racing like it is.  It's right. Okay. Has anyone explained to about anxiety and panic attacks? I don't really know. Okay, well, perhaps it would be helpful to sort of hear a little bit more about that. What we have on top of our kidneys is two little glands and they called our adrenal glands.  Right. And they produce a hormone called adrenalin. Have you heard of that?  Yes, I have heard of that okay. And what adrenalin does is it prepares us for situations of fight or flight? Is that a term you perhaps remember from biology at school? I do. I do. Yeah. I Do you remember what we mean by fight or flies? I think like, if you're in a scary situation, you fight or you run away, basically your body sort of triggers that. Yeah to do it. Yes, exactly. It's what's released to allow you to do the flight or fight response in the adrenaline. So when your body needs to get ready to do something, it's surges out a load of adrenaline, and the adrenaline basically gets you ready for action.  Right. So it does things like it puts your heart rate up, it makes your breathing speed up, you're ready to run. It can sometimes make people feel as though their mouth is dry. It can sometimes make people feel a bit lightheaded. But those are the kinds of symptoms that you can get. All of those actually Okay. What often happens with people with panic is that the first time that happens the first adrenaline release Out of the blue, perhaps at times of stress, and you mentioned that there was stuff going on at work, and you're feeling a bit stressed out and you're in town, it was a bit hot. So that may have been what was behind that very first panic attack. What happens to people is that once they've had one panic attack, they go on to have more.  Hmm. And the reason for that is that once you've had something like that happen to you, you're kind of there thinking, Oh, will this happen again?  Is that something that you are Absolutely sure. I have started to really monitor my heart And when it starts to race, I start to get worried. And then it starts getting faster and faster So it does feel that's Yeah, you describing it Exactly. Julie, that's what we call hyper vigilance. So you they're kind of keeping a bit of an eye on your heart. And for most of us, our heart rate will go up and down all through the day, but most of us don't worry about it, because we don't notice it.  Right. But because you've had a panic attack you they're thinking, What's my heart doing?  Yeah. And then the minute it starts to change, you clock it You notice it, and then you start to get anxious thoughts, you might worry And I really start worrying, thinking thinking, is it going to be now? You know, is my heart gonna stop beating Right, So you get those kinds of anxious and they're very frightening, because you're thinking, Oh, my goodness me could my heart's on that makes you even more anxious, and that causes even more adrenalin to be released.  Right And that makes the symptoms even more pronounced. And then that makes you believe even more that there's something wrong with you. Does that make sense to what might be happening? It does make sense doctor One of the things that you have been doing, which is something that a lot of people with anxiety do is that you've started to, to avoid doing things that trigger it off.  Yeah, like not walking to town or anything like that anymore.  Exactly. And whilst in the short term that sort of alleviates your symptoms, because you don't have to get panicky, what's happening is that the more you avoid doing things, the less likely you are to ever get round to finding out whether or not anything awful, really happens.  Right yeah. Does that make sense? It Does. it just makes sense Well, if we all started to tackle this as if it was an anxiety problem, there are a number of approaches, we can think about tablets. And we're gonna think about other kind of talking approaches. There are pros and cons to those and side effects and things that we need to discuss. So I'm just slightly watchful of the time, we seem to be coming to the end of today's session for the appointment, but all right, well, I wonder is whether we should meet again, perhaps next week, and look again, more carefully at some of the treatment options and think together about which might suit you best.  Okay how would that sound? You know, that's fine. That's fine.  Any other questions before we end this session No, I will make an appointment to see you next week I'll see you next week. Okay, thank you, doctor.  Pleasure. All right. Bye bye.","Patient heart starts to race like boom boom and get chest pains. Patient cant catch breath and get very afraid like gonna have to die. Patient is avoiding sex in case that puts heart rate up. It began six months ago, pressure at work went to town patient had the first of these attacks. Patient had an ECG. therapist agrees with Dr. Jones and do not think there is anything wrong with heart because ECG is normal. Patient does not smoke, blood pressure is fine, fit and active. patient is worried about his dad  having had a heart attack but he was lot older than him. SO the patient is not really in the same risk. Therapist diagnosed this might be anxiety that is giving these symptoms. Therapist explained patient about anxiety and panic attacks. Patient started monitoring heart and when it start to race but patient gets worried. Therapist told it is hyper vigilance."

Well, I know we live in my room much. So have to wait till they go out and  I get out to bring food but they have been doing stuff to my food. Okay, what do you think's happening to your food? they're poisoning it. Okay, are you actually eating much at the moment?  No. Okay, and with all this happening and this says that you don't feel very safe I've got that right. Okay, have you felt the need to know to take steps to protect yourself in any way?  Well I've got a knife, okay. And a baseball bat Is this just in case the came in my I room.I don't want to hurt anyone. I feel like I've got to protect myself. It's like cornering me to do this right. Okay. Have you felt the need to use either the knife or the baseball bat so far to take it out with you for protection? No, no, I don't want to get caught. Just in my room. Okay. Has it ever got so bad Andy that you felt the need to hurt yourself or even kill yourself as the only way out the only way of coping with it? I saw about getting some pills but I couldn't leave the house. I can't even when you say getting some pills, that'd be to take an overdose of tablets? Yeah but you've not actually done anything about that so far? right? yeah Okay. In the past have you ever had any problems either with your temper or getting into fights being aggressive either with your housemates or anybody else? I'm not that kind of person. I don't want to I don't want to hurt anyone. They Just drive me into this. And can I just check again you've not been in trouble with the police or anything like that. No never Okay. With all this that's going on. Is there any way at the moment Andy That you feel safe? At my parents house right. Okay.  And have you seen much of your parents recently? Yeah. I don't want to drag them into this I don't want my five known about. And throughout this last couple of months when you've had all these worries, have you ever worried that your parents might in some way be involved in this conspiracy? I thought about it but no. Okay. Okay. Can I just check out a couple of background things with you, Andy, your general health is that okay Generally fit and well?  Yeah. No ill, there's nothing wrong with that. It's just this thing in my head. And you're not on any regular medication from your own doctor at this stage. Don't take any. Okay. What about other drugs And by that I'm meaning alcohol cannabis pills, Anything else? I don't I don't drink much alchohol. Right. Okay. And what about drugs like cannabis? Is this moment No, I think it's important I hear about this is wouldn't be something we'd be discussing with your mom. Likely weed Would that be regularly to most days? Yeah. And how much would you be spending on weed? 10 buck. Okay, so you have a 10 buck lesson you have a day of weed any other drugs? I'm thinking in particular things like speed or or pills. Bit of a speed. Okay. Its on a regular basis Andy? late the weekend. Okay, when was the last time I didn't even had any speed for a week ago Okay, any other drugs at all?  No. it's not. It's not the drug right? This is doesn't matter how my face I get this. Constantly. Yes. always there. Okay, I guess the reason I was checking I think we've picked up on is sometimes when people are having the kinds of experiences that you are they find if they take certain drugs, it could make things feel a lot worse. I just wanted to check. that hadn't been your experience. No Okay, okay. Appreciate from what you're saying, You're really very worried about this MI5 conspiracy and that that's the cause of the difficulties that you're having at the moment. I just wanted to check with you Do you think it could be due to anything else? And I mean, I've obviously met other people who've had similar experiences, and sometimes they're extremely stressed, some people might be mentally unwell, and it's worth it whether any of these things might be relevant to you at the moment. No, because I'm not ill.  Alright. It's them and I've read books on this as well. I don't the government know about the them to know that they do this to loads of people. I don't know how they can get away with it. I have done nothing wrong, I don't know why they're doing this to me.  Okay. Sure, I think I can appreciate that. I guess what I'm wondering is whether you think there's anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you as a doctor that sometimes meeting with someone like a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful. Do you think any of those things would help you at the moment? I don't know. I mean, I want to hear really, because someone warmer, tried to. I don't want to worry about I've tried to talk to her about it. She doesn't understand she doesn't really believe me. I mean, do you believe me?  Well, I certainly believe that you're having a really difficult time at the moment, I guess I'm not too sure about is what's causing this and I'm, I'm less sure this is due to MI5 is what I'm wondering, is it perhaps you're not as well as you might be at the moment. I mean, we've been through a lot of questions And what I'm thinking is we need to try and come up with a way of supporting you through this Someone drink cuz I know your mom is I think she's waiting in the waiting room might be a good chance now to get your mum in and then perhaps the three of us can put our heads together, have a bit of a discussion about where to go from here and try and think of getting you some some proper support. Would that be alright if I got your mum in? Okay,  okay, if you want to sit there then I'll just get your mum okay.","Patient thinks housemates are working for MI5 for two months and really very worried about this MI5 conspiracy that's the cause of the difficulties.

I think maybe she says about things in my life. Right. Okay. And how often is it that you get these voices out there all the time Yeah, generally the sort of sitting there butAnd then you sometimes the louder than others and it's like the other night, the mice will have been in the room.  Right. Did you think they were in the room? No, I mean, I know that they're not there But it's like they're just so loud in my head. So can I just clarify that other voices seem as though they're inside your head? Or was it like my voice coming through your ears? No. So inside inside your head, yeah okay. Okay. Okay. And am I right in thinking that they they trouble you more at times when you get stressed out? Yeah, right.  Okay. Okay. Can I ask you a few more general questions about how you are in your mood? How, how would you say that you, you feel generally kind of in yourself. Most of the time, it's not just like being me. Sounds as it can be very difficult sometimes. It sounds like you've used cutting in the past to help are there any of the things that you do to help when you feel really bad. Drinking, smoke few spliffs now and then so much now, in the past I don't know, I just had a funny thing about food, you know it's all i binge and then just throw it back up again.  Okay, and that was in the past, but but not recently. I haven't done it recently. And can I ask Jane, it sounds like when you cook the other night, you were doing it, sort of to kind of get rid of the pain. Can I just clarify where you're doing it to try and kill yourself. No. Okay. Have there ever been times in the past when you have tried to kill yourself? late teens, then around when it was 19 I don't know. It just got to a point where I didn't want to be anymore. So I took some tablets So that was in your late teens and at the time you took the tablets because you wanted to be dead. Is that right? Yeah Okay. Okay, but you've not wanted to be dead since that time in your late teens?  No. Okay. Can I ask a few more general questions about your home situation? Who is it Is it is there anyone at home with you? Well my daughter used to live with me, okay But right now she is gone to live with her dad now Right? So she's gone to live with her dad that quite recently a year ago and what was what was that about? she just couldn't cope with the fact that I was cutting myself might run into friends. She knew it was happening. And I suppose I suppose one of the big things as well as relationships I have the relationships you had? Hmm Can you tell me a bit more about that? Like the one we just had with Mark, you know, starts off being great. And then I got, I got really scared, really scared that they're gonna leave and then turns into a fights and they end up leaving anyway.  Right. And it sounds like your daughter struggled with that. Yeah, I mean, I suppose she didn't whether she was coming out going really Okay. Well, there are lots of relationships like that.  Yeah. Okay. You've seen Jane a few people in the past you've seen a couple of psychiatrists and a couple of counselors. As anything that anyone's done for you before been particularly helpful. I've been crap was Philip being passed from pillar to post. So you've not found anything that people have done particularly helpful in helping you to manage your relationships and your cutting and the things that seem to go wrong for you. Its llike nobody's listening to me, You know, I think you're the only person who's actually sat and listened to what I've got to say, what do you think it would be worse? Given that this this has been such a long standing problem clearly does get gets in the way, quite a lot of aspects of your life. Do you think it would be worth us? meeting again one more time, and perhaps having a think together about how the service could best support you with this? What do you mean one more time? Can I see you, you know, properly.  Well, the way that we work here in this department is that we we see people once or twice and try and think with them about the best place for them to be and then refer them on to the most appropriate parts of the service. So it wouldn't be usual for me to see. See you more than once or twice Strain Yeah like I said, You're the only person that's listened to me. I know it's very difficult to open up to people and I know that you have opened up here today and it can feel quite hard that you're not going to continue to see me but it is the way that we work here is to pass you on to somebody who is perhaps a bit more appropriate for your needs Jane. So would it be okay for me to book you in to come back and see me say next week for a second appointment and we can perhaps have a think of where to go from there. That'd be okay.",Patient cut arms couple of nights ago and came after the relationship ended with boyfriend. It was only couple of weeks. Patient asked boyfriend to move in and he didn’t want to.

112,"Summarize: Hello there. My name is Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPS in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you? Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine.  Okay, that's fine. Okay, so, Barbara, I'm seeing you today. But I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you. Is that right? Yes. Dr. Brown is my doctor. Okay. What is it this boy you see me today? Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach. And Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. I thought perhaps I'd come and see you to see if you could help. Right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems? Umm Well, I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. It very often feels bloated. I I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes and other times it stops. It's a real stabbing feeling. I often have the urge to go to the toilet, and and I pass very smelly wind. So quite a few symptoms and some of them sound more troublesome to you. Yes. Okay. And how long has this been going on? Well, I I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea And I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday? Yes,Yes. Okay.And What sort of treatments have you tried for this before? Well, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. But I've been to the health shop and and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different tablets and medicines for different things. Now oh and Imodium, I have Imodium in my hand back all the time, just in case, right. So these different tablets that you've got from the herbal shop, how are you taking them?  Oh, well, different tablets. You know, I don't have the same problem every day. So I'll take some tablets for certain symptoms, right. Other tablets for other things. So my my writing thinking you perhaps decide on a day to day basis, what you're going to take depending on what your stomach's doing.  Yeah okay. Okay. And what About tests if you have any tests for these problems. Yes, I had in the early days, I had a gastros,, guess.  they're are the gastroscopy? yes, And at the same time, I had a barium enema, right, that was very uncomfortable.  Okay. But now I've tried you. I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything. He's, he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now, as far as he's concerned, sent me back to the doctor. Right. sounds as though you're not happy with that? Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money out there. And he's decided that I've had enough tests small and  you know, if you go on the internet, there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for. Right If I had a bit more money, I'd go Private. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it. So you feel as though actually enough hasn't been done in the way. He's not.  There's loads more he could do, I'm sure. Right. Okay. It sounds like you've had these problems now for about four years, you've you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. You've tried a lot of tablets, some prescribed some herbal remedies, and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that you've been investigated thoroughly enough. Is that is that about it? Yes Right. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how is all of this affecting you day to day, how's how's it affecting your life? Well, it's had quite, quite a big impact. I mean, the first thing the biggest thing, I suppose is that I, I went from being full time to part time at work. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. And so in part time, In the end, I hope about a year ago I stopped work altogether, right. I missed that. I missed the girls we used to use least once a week night to the pictures or drink. That's one thing. That's something you quite enjoyed. Yes, yes. Yes, we just have a laugh.  Okay. I used to go to swing in shape. I used to go to an exercise class that was I missed the exercise Actually, that was once a week, but you know, the thing was, I wasn't comfortable. Never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was going to be taken shorter So I stopped that. right Then well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. That's another thing we don't do anymore Now.That's Quite a few things really. Yeah, it does, It does sound as though over the last few years, your life has really changed quite a lot because of the symptoms. It's It sounds like you're doing very few of the things that you used to do.  Hmm, right.  What is it you spend your average day doing now? Well, I put around the house. I spent perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say draw you in don't do. I read a bit the old magazines but generally I'm at home. Right. Okay. Okay. And have you been any times of the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms for example, have there been any times when things have been better for you? Last year My son got married. And I have to say I was worried that that I wouldn't be able to cope with it that I wouldn't be feeling well enough. But surprisingly enough, I was in good form. I think it was about three weeks in the summer getting ready for it and the whole heart of the wedding, but I was in good, really good form for that. Yeah. That was a good time. Right. And how were you told me symptoms then? I hardly noticed them. Yes. It seemed to clear up nice which was good, right, That's interesting And are there any times when you Tummy symptoms bother you More seem particularly bad? Well, it's I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. It's particularly uncomfortable. I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He, he travels with his job and he can be away a couple of times A month And that's not very often not good, then I have to say, so you notice it's the worst when your husband's not around. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more. I don't know when he's not there. Right. Now, you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong here? Well, he he thinks it's all in my head. He's he says it's stress.  Right Okay. Um, what do you think? Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I hit too much physical pain for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's it's a real pain. And if you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it Well, I mean, I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up in the early stages. But I think I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS friend of mines got that and it sounds similar. And then other times, I think, I wonder if it's an ulcer on a really bad day, I start to think it might be  cancer right My mother in law my mother in law died of cancer last year and she had a growth the doctor didn't investigate that by the time they found it, it was the size of a football and it was it was too late to operate them. So you know, when I go to bed at night now and I just feel and make sure there's nothing different going on And yeah, I worry about that. So you're, you're kind of prodding having a feel at night just to see if you can feel anything. Yeah. So just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there You know Right. Okay. Okay. So just to make sure that I've got the story straight you've, you've seen Dr. Brown for couple of years, you've tried a variety of medications, some prescribed some from the herbal shop, and none of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations, but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And times you worried that this could be something quite serious like a cancer. Is that if I got the story, right, yes Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today? Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether you know, with new eyes and new way of looking at at the problem. You probably know about different tests and new tests that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments, that perhaps you could send me for some different tests. Right. Right. So you're hoping that I'd send you four more tests? Hmm. Well, I think this, there's got to be something that tests might reveal.  Right. Okay. Well, I think Barbara having having heard his story and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and they've not shown anything. And you symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So it'd be I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests.  So it's like, do you think it's all in my head that you're going to be like Dr. Brown, you think I'm imagining all of this? No, I think that you clearly have pain. And it clearly you have lots of physical symptoms and they clearly getting in the way of your life and causing you a lot of disability. I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Sometimes these things can go together. I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married, and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much. Sometimes somehow his symptoms then will seem greater. So I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara is if the might be some kind of a link with you between how you feel In your mind and what's going on in your life, and and how much you symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility? Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain. I'm not saying that the pains in your mind. I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really with those, none of those have really helped you. I guess I'm wondering whether now, it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems. What sort of approach? Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life. I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have been Really shrunk down. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of, is that right? Well, I just can't do them. Yeah, I can't do them anymore. And I guess I wonder it sounds as though you've you've dropped doing those things, because you felt you couldn't do them. But I wonder if in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling unhappy with the way that that your life is at the moment. And I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you? Oh, I don't know. I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day. And maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things. Even if it's just meeting up with your female friends once a week. And whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. And the fact that you, you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth of sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of these symptoms Worse, I guess. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for, say, two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference? What two, three months is a long time if there is something going on, I mean, that's what happened to my mother in law, you know, they they left her and didn't spot it and well, I guess, if we if we did decide to work together like this, this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly, we can keep an eye on your symptoms and if they change then we can investigate as appropriate proof They stay the same, then, you know, we could be pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that that we're missing. How would that sound? So, what are you saying then that I should come back and see you I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun talk about it. And I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it, and then perhaps come back, perhaps if you booked him for a double slot next week. And that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. And perhaps if you could also bring your your tablets in or make a list of them. We can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound Barbara? Okay, well, to make an appointment for next week, come back and see you again and talk about it a bit more. Yes, I think so. I think that would be a good, a good start. And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking here and bring all the bottles down. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. So see you again next week I'll make an appointment next week. All right. Thank you Barbara. Okay, okay. bye bye","Patient has tummy problem which causes her terrible discomfort.

113,"Summarize: Good morning Curtis. Good seeing you again. Go ahead and have a seat. How are feeling today? I am feeling well Okay, good. So So today's your first visit would be today, were you okay with traffic?   Yeah Did you find parking okay? Yeah I did Okay. Okay, I just wanted to interview I know you had some concerns you called me so we're going to go over that today. What I wanted to do first of all was asked you what brings you here today to my office?  I'm thinking about the therapy, now looking into some therapy lessons. What what kind of classes are you looking for what exactly? drug and alcohol perhaps Okay. Okay. All right, are you right now today, Are you using any drugs today? very less mostly used honestly at least they go a party with my friends and use a lot like almost on a daily basis but don't do it as much All right. What is your number one drug of choice right now? We wait okay now do you smoke with friends by yourself? Yes usually with friends actually. Okay Do you find yourself doing it at home or do you go out? my mom doesn't allow so easily go Parks you know after school or something and do you feel that that's something that you need to help you function or is it something that you like? just it's a habit and helps you relax and honestly keeps me down Do you go smoke weed with other friends or by yourself? Um, I usually go with my other friends because they were that my influences to begin with. Right Okay, so I mean, do you feel that you need to function or helps you function better Or is it just something that you're just experimenting with? Or what what exactly do you It actually helps me function a lot better. And that was not the right choice or anything like that therapy where I can find ways to guide yourself spending a lot of money on? Yeah how much do you spend in a week or what your, your habit like right now? about 200$ That's, you know, pretty much equivalent to about maybe 10 to 10 to 15 hours a day. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, you know, you know, what we want to do is just be able to help you maybe create some some steps to help you begin to phase out in time, I wanted to pretty much identify the problem and that's the marijuana would you say? Maybe there's events in your life that trigger your use. Is there something that which I wanted to ask you? What are what's your family structure like right now? Um, you know, I get along with my family I have a foster family who was born was born was kind of separated from my biological family. So he kind of put me in foster care. It was like that since I was two years old, and from two to 13 a little bit my two other siblings. So pretty much should have been raised by your foster parents and your biological parents are not independent. Okay. Now, in your family, how many siblings and your what and what What number are you using?  I'm actually the only one so do you feel maybe there was added responsibility put on you or do you know that you live together? There was only two of us. My sister, one of my sisters, and what do we have to do my sisters? We just lived together and I wasn't didn't have full responsibility. Right. And so your other four siblings? Where did they go? I don't find them separate? Yes. You were raised by your foster parents And how do you feel about that? And how does that make you feel as far as foster? I'm just again, my brother when I was in school, and it was a little harsh. A little bit army, but I'm kind of getting over it now. Right? I tried to contact them but it's not working. Right. Yeah.  Okay. So they're pretty much your biological sibs. And your, your, your foster parents are pretty much the ones that Rachel those are your parents.  Yeah. Okay. Then also, as you were, you know, living together at home, how are you disciplined? Or who are you disciplined by who discipline? My mom, I'm not so much of my dad, he was kind of like that col Relax, right, You know, my mom should discipline it can go from being grounded from overpaying, you know, from show take our equipment like PlayStations or phones or lectron. So that was pretty much a consequence for your behavior equal to continental. Would you say that mom was consistent? she pretty much disciplined everybody. Yeah, yeah. Everybody's saying that  So growing up, do you feel that discipline helped you?  Yeah, yeah, the whole drug use, but I think it helped me  kind of set some boundaries. Yeah. Does your mother know that you smoke marijuana. She doesn't know how to do it. At This exact model because a while ago, I kind of stopped didn't do as much I told him, so she doesn't really doing as much. Okay. The reason why I'm asking is because in order for us to help you, we want to be able to develop a good support system. So we want to, you know, maybe in time will include you know, your mom and let her know and you know, getting some help getting some treatment. But that was, you know, some of the questions I had for as far as you know, your family how you were raised. And now tell me a little bit about yourself when you were growing up, were you more of an introvert or an extrovert meaning, you know, without going or you more going on to be, you know, in the center spot.. Yeah, exactly. So, you know, make that makes people attention seeker class clown, you know, that kind of explains why you know, this conversation has gone well, you pretty much open Now, right now, hopefully British Columbia, you're 20 years old. And do you have any girlfriend?  I do you have a girlfriend actually three weeks off to some pretty much Asian. And do you have How long have you known or how long have you been together ? for two months, I've been off and on with girlfriends because it's kind of been, oh, drug use and don't want to deal with it so often on relationships and sometimes single sometimes has been, you know, not that good for me. Right.  So your past relationships pretty much haven't been good yeah Did the your partners know that you were smoking or came out? Yeah. Were you upfront with them or is it something they found out in there? They said, You know, I don't want  Yeah Yeah exactly So some of your choices and some of your decisions that are a consequence, bad choices, decisions, Yeah okay. So what we want to do is we want to be able to identify, you know, your problem and that's, you know, the marijuana use, maybe what triggers you to go use marijuana and then maybe then begin to identify some of the emotions that are behind it. But you know, you've grown up with six siblings that you all if you go to the same school or your different schools, that becomes a little bit about your, your school history. Um, you know, her sister who is one years younger than me, and so we were kind of on the same level right now. Meet her was at the same school for a while, and she got into this class, right, and it's just human to underscore and I was kind of Escobar myself. And I went Rule 70 this was a younger sister. Yes, this one choosing only one years younger.  So you're pretty close to her? Yeah. Yeah. During high school, I went to seven different high schools. Okay, it's been hard, right, but I'm going to go a little bit there, right. Around two years ago, I got my high school diploma, graduated. Now in high school, how did that affect you being moved around seven times? What was your foster parent moving you? Did you move physically your house?  No, it was actually when I was 13. I was told, you know, 13 more moved from my foster parents. And when I was 13, I went to a group home. Right. So, you know, when I moved from place to place from Groupon, Groupon, this area of the city would vary. So kind of like, the different schools, right Yeah. So then you had to make a whole new set of friends. Exactly. And that was the challenge with meeting new friends. Not knowing who You know your friends are what they do. Right? What are some of the subjects that maybe were that came easy to you that you enjoy that were you know what you did well and what some of the areas that you excelled in spelling, I suppose in every spelling bee room, everyone, but I wasn't every spelling so spelling and reading are your strong points. Yeah, that kind of explains why you're cute. You're pretty good. As far as you know, being vocal, you're okay. You'd like to talk to people, you engage well with people. So spelling English, what were some of the classes that maybe you didn't really enjoy? Or you had a challenge with math, science",Patient usually go with other friends because they were that my influences to begin with. It actually helps him function a lot better. And that was not the right choice or anything like that therapy where I can find ways to find ways. Patient smokes marijuana and mother doesn't know how to do it.
114,"Summarize: Hi Miss Clark, My name is Alan Lime. I'm a social worker at the Family Health Center. Dr. Steele asked me if I would spend some time with you today. I'm really glad that you're here. I'm just curious as to why he would send you to me. Well, I came to see Dr. Seal last week because of increasing stress and anxiety, that's kind of getting the best of me. And in the course of my appointment with him, he was asking how I was dealing with that stress. And I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent and maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and, and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something. Yeah. So he, he actually see me because you went to him for increased stress. And he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase And prior to prescribing anything, you want to make sure that you at least had someone to talk to that I suppose. Okay. So you filled in one of the Pink Sheets and I take a look at that. He told me to fill that out and bring it with me. Okay, thank you. So, you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week, you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well. And that you have one or two drinks in one setting  typically, yeah.  And maybe monthly you have more than that. What what's what kind of drinks do you have? What do you do when you typically drink wine with my meals? You know, again, one or two, typically and more frequently, three or four. My stress is increased. So it's time to increase your strength a little more. Well, based on what you put here, you get it gives you six points on this scale scale ranging from zero to 46 points will put you in what we would consider an at risk zone. So if it's okay with you to talk a little bit about that, okay okay. So that was sunset run zero to 40. It's not a sort of super high risk, but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress might be some physical ailments related to alcohol as well could could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there, or even stay there. This is a typical standard drink size over here, I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine or not, I feel the glass up so maybe a little more than that maybe the little space it's upset, perhaps a drink drink and a half each one. So that also increased a little bit more. So perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here. And for women, healthy woman your age, no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be low or no risk and one seven in one week, seven total in total a week and what you say here is that even on this sheet, you're perhaps already drinking more than that. So what do you make of all that? That news to me, you know, I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy. You know, no more than seven in a week? That seems kind of prohibitive? Yeah, it seems seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking or what you consider to be healthy drinking. And certainly there's there's conflicting information out there about what's healthy and what's not healthy. Imagine the increased stress work because we're concerned doctor seal as your stress increases, and if you were to describe you anything, maybe some interaction between the two, that would also be a concern for him. I would, I would think, so if you would, what is it that you like about alcohol? Well, you know, it does, at least in the moment, temporarily reduce my stress. And I you know, like a good glass of wine. I don't don't drink the cheap stuff. I like the expensive. See, like the taste of it. And it does help to lower the stress, even if it's just for the fun of me drinking. What's not so good things about alcohol for you. Um, well, you know, the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kinda yaak and, of course, part of my stress is finances. And I mentioned I like the good stuff. And so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden, your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking. Yeah, kind of defeating the purpose they're  the drink introduce stress and increasing stress at the same time. So on the one hand, it low is it on the other hand, it's increasing kind of the seesaw teeter totter effect. What do you make of that, given that on one hand, it lowers on the other hand, it increases and and now it's increasing even more? And maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress. Yeah. Imagine investment thoughts so that what have you thought of trying? Well, I've exercised in the past and that helps. Right now. My schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do. That's why I came to see Dr. seal. I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help. You know, when I'm feeling overwhelmed, And he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink, the level that you are drinking, that whatever he prescribes you, there may be an interaction with it to mention that he's concerned. I'm not completely sure. So you've had some success in the past of changing behaviors. And if you were to decide to make any changes here that sounds like you could draw upon that to make those changes. How important would it be for you on a scale of zero to 10? I have a low visual hero that if zero is not important, ten is very important to do something about your drinking wine. Well, I mean, if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking, then it's fairly important, maybe about seven.  It's it's pretty up there. What do you choose a seven out of five or four? Well, again, I got to get things under control. You know, My kids are dependent on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress. And so, you know, all those responsibilities there's a lot riding on your decision on what to do with this. What if anything would bring up to an eight or nine on that scale? Well, the you know, the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction, I certainly can't afford to, you know, have any more stress.  So, yeah,  so so you you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it. And if lowering your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do. hmmm How confident are you that you could do something about your drinking? I'm pretty confident and you know, probably about a seven or an eight  Okay, so it's pretty high up there again, and what if, what if anything, would you choose to do would it be to cut down would it be to quit? I'm just curious about that I you know, I like a lot A glass of wine, I don't want to quit altogether, I'd be willing to try cutting that. But now if it's going to, if Dr. Seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety, and it meant that I had to not drink at all, I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time. So you'd be willing to stop altogether. That's what was indicated by the physician. Okay. So based on that, how ready are you to do anything right now, whether it's to cut back whether it's to quit? Well, again, you know, if if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress, then then you know, I be pretty ready. Again, maybe about an on that scale, maybe an eight. Okay, so that's, that's pretty hot there as well. It sounds as though you're pretty motivated to do something about this right now, given any responsibilities given your children learning at this point. And just on lowering anxiety, in general, it sounds and that's one of your goals as well. Well, I'm pretty confident Once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do, you'll be able to follow through with it. Based on your experience in the past of making behavior changes. I mentioned some things that you can draw upon. What's one thing that you could do? Imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress. Oh, I you know that the exercise but again, that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now. I'm hoping that Dr. Seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of  one of the things we can offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this this area of your life, this area of increased stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make an appointment for you for like before you leave today to talk to somebody That would be nice that also has some information here if you're interested, some pamphlet on alcohol and and how what helps limits on how it may be affected by medications that you take as well. And I wish you lots of luck. It sounds as though you're really committed to making this shift in this change. And I imagine doctors still want to follow up with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks. Okay Again, I look forward to speaking to you in the future. All right, thank you very much.","patient come to discuss about anxiety and stress. patient is habitual of drinking.

115,"Summarize: Hi, dog Have a seat. Yeah. Hi. And so we just talked on the phone. Right. Yes, yes. I saw Joe Dr. Donovan. Yeah. And he did that scan for gall stones. Okay. And so what happened from there then just tell me a little bit about what's happened so that I'm up to speed. I went for that scan and then I was a bit surprised actually, they actually rang me up and a few days afterwards and said that I needed another scan to check things out. Okay, so I was there. It was on Monday this week. Don't let anything then. Okay. So in between the scan happening and the second scan happening Was it the department? No, no, it was the it was a nice old sound girl who rang me saying they were booking this disappointments for this extra scan. And did they give you an idea why they needed to do extra? No, they didn't actually I mean, I try to ask you always do and play sweet talk lady, but she was not pretending.  Okay. And I do have any thoughts yourself or any worries about why they were calling back? I guess it was gallstones. So just tell me a little bit about what symptoms you've been having them but we do have a scan result here today and there's some scuffs on it. Right. I just like to make sure that I know what's been happening to you first of all, and then we'll go into detail  all started a few months ago Ray with his tummy pain. Yeah. And then I saw your colleague, and he said we better get a scan. Yeah, I went for that scan. It was only about two weeks ago. And I got literally four or five days later. got the phone call? I needed this additional scan. So I went on Monday. Okay. Okay. And so do you still have pain at the abdomen? Yes. Yeah, it's just there all the time.  Okay. Well, as I said, you scan result has come through to me today.  Yes I'm afraid I'm afraid there is something that's potentially a little bit worrying on it. Really? Yeah. So what's what's the worrying thing that you found? Well, if I take you back to the first scan first. So what it appears that that showed is that there was something suspicious on what we call the pancreas gland suspicious? Yeah. So there is a gland that sort of the top of your abdomen, which is quite closely evolved, right, and called the pancreas. And when they did the ultrasound scan, which is a good scan, but isn't particularly detailed, right, there was something on it that they saw that they wanted a bit more info  All right. So that's why they called you back for the second scan That doesn't sound good, does they? which was a CT scan, which is a detail that we're likely to be talking about.  Right. So the second scan, I showed that there definitely is something on your pancreas. Really? When I say something, what we worry about is whether or not this could be a cancer god. I didn't expect that. God, I am only 47 cancer.  I'm really sorry to have to break it to you like this, but I felt that it was important that as soon as I knew that I communicated that to you. So, I mean, I know that I've just dropped a big bombshell on you. Oh, yes. God Have you got any Any questions in a minute? Have you got anything that you can query? What's the pancreas and I have got cancer. What can I can make can they cut it out? And it depends. And basically a pancreas is a brand that sort of sits at the top of the abdomen, as I said, and it controls some of the sort of the hormones, the fluids that your body prefers the body. Because it's at the back of the abdomen, often we don't know very much about it until it starts causing a bit of a problem, like your pain that you've been getting. So that probably explains why you've not had many other symptoms.  Right And the answer is, I don't know what could be done about it. But we need to ask a specialist  what we usually do. This situation is asked especially today to see what has happened, think about what was cooking. Right? Do they agree that it could be potentially cancer and how do we find out what it definitely is Okay. Okay. So I understand that I've just thrown a whole lot of information at you and I just hasn't expected that so. I mean, is there is there anybody that you could that you could bring in with them? Oh, quit I went on a bit of a chat maybe tomorrow when you've had a bit. Bit more time. I suppose I could love myself. No doubt come by myself actually. Yeah, okay. It will just be easier. Feel Sure.  I mean, I think it's important to say that we don't know for definite what this is. We have to imagine that it is something like a cancer until we can prove what is right. So we do everything very quickly. Yeah, try and get some answers. Right. But we don't know any definite nothing certain in a minute. But I do appreciate that. I've just given you a little bit of time. So my door is open and yes. Okay. Have you got any questions? No. I've taken the liberty of printing off a little bit of something about pancreatic cancer, if that's what it is.  Okay, some of it's a little bit a little bit scary. And as I said, we don't know, nothing certain yet. I wonder if you might want to come back to see me. So what this does is it just explains a little bit about what the pancreas is right?  Okay. And it talks about cancer in general. The types of ways in which you can affect the pancreas okay. Okay. How we do it and how we work out what we do about it talks about the different types of scans that you've had and this one is CTS. Yes.  Okay. And then depending on what they find, yeah, it gives you a brief run through of the different types of treatment. Okay did you want to have a read through this and then Maybe tomorrow. Yeah, we like tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. I like this. I'll see you tomorrow.",patient came with his tummy pain .

116,"Summarize: Well, that's the housekeeping finish with Kathleen. So perhaps you'd like to tell me a bit about what brings you here today? Well, actually, Wendy, I'm having a lot of trouble coping with with my job. The hours are working are supposed to be 830 to 330. And lately, I've just got so much work given to me. I'm having difficulty getting through the whole day with it. And I've got a couple of teenage boys that I pick up after school every day because he's so naughty. They're not allowed to go on the bus. And so I've made my hours 830 to 330. So I give them a chance to Get out of school and then at 330 on on supposed to be there to pick them up. But lately, it's been later and later on getting there sometimes 430 the other day was five and the boys were just the naughty boys you notice and and they're everywhere. They're all over the school they're getting into trouble and and then I'm late home preparing dinner for my husband and then he gets annoyed and on it goes, it's getting too much.  So you're supposed to finish at 330 Why do you think you're not finishing it through 330? too much work? And here's what's happening. We'll we'll do one dog work in a doctor's surgery. I don't know if I mentioned that. One doctor employed me but there are four within the practice. And I'm doing work for all of them when really I should only be doing work for one right, So that's really the problem that we'll get You work and there's no way you can fit into the the times that you were employed to work.  No. And I just can't say no to them, but they put the they put the work in my in tray. And then and then it's not get into my head try and write those fallen. It's there the next day in. And it's It's just all too much for us.  I can see that I can see you're getting quite stressed about it. So have you had any thoughts about anything you might be able to do about this? Kathleen? Is there anything you think you could do? Well, apart from just I don't I don't believe it's such a good job, but I'll probably have to, I'll have to, I'll have to tell some. I'll have to tell her. I think I'm gonna have to tell her  so you really do feel that you need to talk to the boss that includes you and explain what the problem is. Is this something you feel comfortable about doing? No, no, no, no. Oh, she's easy and And she is lovely and I just thought I don't I don't want to annoy her.  Okay, because she was lovely there. She says, Do you think that if you were able to go and talk to her, that she'd actually be quite receptive to listening to you? Well, of course she, wouldn't she okay. What I'm going to suggest Kathleen is that we do something called a role play. And what that is, is that we act out the situation, whatever it is. And in your case, it's going to be you going and talking to your boss and trying to explain to her that you've got a problem trying to fit your work into the house, which is supposed to be working. So you'll be playing, you end up playing your boss. Now, obviously, you're not going to get exactly the same responses from your boss that you'll get from me today. But it does give you a chance to think about the way you might approach it, to practice it, and to get a response that you can then react to and practice your way through a possible scenario. And what this could do happily Give you a bit more confidence about the swing.  What do you put in a? Well, we practice it right now. Oh, I can, what we'll do is, you'll be you. And I'll be the doctor that you're going to see. Let's just think about a couple of things to get it started. So I pretend that I'm going to be coming into her tutorial. Okay,  well, what do you think would be the best time of day to do it? Oh, topic day time of day. I'm so busy so busy during the day, I'm probably early morning might be the best first first thing in the morning.  Sounds like a good idea because then you don't have to worry. That's true. Okay, so have you had any got any thoughts about what you might say? How are you going to introduce? I suppose I could say to her, is this a good time to talk?  That's fantastic. Okay because that gives her the chance the opportunity to say well, No, it isn't. Could you come in five minutes. I'm sorry. Oh, Go straight into it. That's really good. Okay. Should we give it a try?  Okay. All right. So I'm gonna get you to stand up and pretend that you knocking on the doors that what you do. Yes, yes. All right. So I want you to get out and just do that and then come back in as if you're having to see your boss and the boss to tell me what to  do the role plays out. yeah Okay. Now good time to talk. Yeah, sure. Good, thank you. Well, the problem is Marianne on on having I'm having problems coping with my workload at the moment, mainly because it's putting me here, too late in the afternoon. Remember when you first put me on miles were 830 to 330 as well. No, I'm finishing later and later 430, sometimes 5 I've got too much work and a lot to finish on time because I have to pick them up from school and you know what they like. So I'm just wondering if if we can work well  obviously you're employed 830 to 330  Kathlleine hours we want you to work so we don't want you working back so first of all, this is important that you know that we want you to leave at 330 and that's what I want you to do. But from what you're saying the work you're being given doesn't fit into those hours I don't know what's happening here I'm getting too much work from the other doctors All right i don't know i don't think you're not but I didn't think that I'd be getting work of four because this doctors here and is only doing your work. I think I've got the picture. I don't I don't like saying no to them though. I'm glad you came to me. I really need this job. Look. I'm really glad you came to see But obviously 830 to 330 is not enough. It's a long day, early as you're supposed to work. So I need to have a look into this and see what's going on.  It's only half my day. The other half starts when I pick my boys up. And they say naughty they are they are really well, certainly Kathleen. Yes, I'll have a look at it. But I want you to make sure that you do leave at 330 every day. Well, I think because I've done that little rolle play feel a little bit better probably gone and seen the doctor will  help Obviously the responses that I gave are not going to be the ones you'll get from doctor because she is sure this is what she said she. So there'll be something similar, but the important thing is, I think, to work out that first opening gambit, isn't it and it's true and to do that, and then flow on so That's something I want you to think about. Perhaps a few. You guys come and see me next week and about a week perhaps. I have to sit home. Well, let's look at it. What I'd like you to do is think about what we've done today. Yes, but but don't don't. Don't overdo it don't sort of keep it down for your mind. Well, exactly. That's what I was going to say. I can see that you're getting a bit, too. I don't like confrontation. I don't like telling people what to do. I know. Yeah. So having the right words is a help. That will help you to get a bit of confidence there. But importantly, I think we need to relax a bit, don't we? And there are some very simple relaxation exercises that I can teach you that I'd like you to go away and practice. So that horrified by next week when you come, you'll practice those relaxation exercises, because they have things that you can use anyway in any situation. I'll tell you what I know you don't have to lie on the floor. Not for these because that's not very practical before you go see your boss. So, what I suggest is we look at you coming back in a week's time and your practice the relaxation exercises, we'll go through them again, and we perhaps do another role play and then maybe we might be ready to go and do it for real. What do you think?  Okay, that's that sounds good. I feel a little bit more relaxed just thinking about that actually.","One doctor employed patient but there are four within the practice . I just can't say no to them, but they put the they put the work in my in tray . It's just all too much for patient. therapist suggest patient to relax a bit. and tells some relaxation exercises. "
117,"Summarize: Alright, Hi Sandra. Well, we have about half an hour together to sign and how are you feeling right now? What's your awareness? There's a bit of a kind of the situation is different from last time. No, I'm still feeling the same. just just just a little frustrated at the moment. That's all. What is it the frustation like for you? It's just tight feeling that I have I just experienced, it's difficult to put into words but just it just doesn't feel good. So let's shift it to body where in your body you feel this type feeling? I think it's, it's in my chest.  So that's a hot area, feeling around the heart. And what is there in that heart and you pay attention to that, that area in your heart? What What do you find? What sort of thing? Yes, it's just really just a compressing feeling.  I noticed that you have been saying it when you talked about your feelings. And I would like to suggest if you can say instead of being it, and see what happens in your body so go ahead You actually want me to say, okay, yes. My chest feels very tight. I feel very frustrated, angry, angry. So that's what's coming up frustration, anger. So what are you doing this moment with your anger as you said to me right here to chest this moment? just accepting it once you accept that anger inside you, what else do you do with that anger having accepted? it's it's just noticing you're saying it again. Use the word Hi. It's a thing that to acknowledge this is, you know, something out there, we do a lot Something very strong. So it's a safe way to put it. But if you say I feel angry, I feel angry. But who do you feel angry at? My ex husband You ex husband? Hmm, yup Sandra, having just explore some of your feelings around the situation you have, I'm going to suggest that you speak to Jeff on an empty chair. This may be a little uncomfortable. But it helped me to facilitate a process where I become an observer, and you'll be in dialoguing with a party that you are actually having to deal with. And I'll be facilitating for you the process and then pointing out some of the things that we could do to change process okay. It's been Jeff and your imagination that the massive Jeff we're here. I'll bring a chair. Okay. Welcome, Jeff. I mean I welcome Jeff. And, and there's Jeff. Imagine his face looks like how you remember him and bring him in and your fantasy. And then when you're ready to just say whatever comes to you at that moment, this moment spontaneous. Jeff, I feel very frustrated about the situation that you have left me and the children in. I think you understand how hard it is at times and the things that I have to explain to them about about this situation. It bothers me that you don't go out of your way to spend extra time with the children and I really believe that in the future, they, they will come to, to really resent that and, and not look at you as as their father, I, I honestly can't understand why you don't want to spend more time with them. And irrespective of what's happened between between us and and you moving on and, and so forth. I just don't think that that your children and my children should really suffer in that way. we'd like them to have as as normal a life as possible and, and be able to, to be with both of their parents and why you know what is so important rather than them wanting to be with them. It's it's just very hard.  Okay. Okay, so there's a kind of question you understand why this happened, etc. Right? So what next thing we'll do, you'll sit over there, and you will be Jeff and see what Jeff can answer to you as to where he is at. That maybe a little bit difficult But let's do a dialogue as if he were he's not here anyway.  Yeah. So we'll, we'll be having a dialogue between Jeff, imaginary Jeff, and you in the present here and now. Okay. And what is what is he saying? I know they're the hurts and frustration a but any appreciation that he still cares for these children as a father. I really don't have any appreciation for that because the reason the reason that you've given that you're busy, like I'm busy in my life and I still give our children priority, they still take precedence in my life. And I just don't think that that, that that's right  Actually what kind of father you should be for the children? You should be proactive in wanting to save them. And I wouldn't mind if you wanted to see them more than then what we have agreed is there are times when when you Want to do something spontaneous and and see then then then feel free to contact us and, and see if it's okay. Sounds like a very good idea. Good offer you Jeff, are you prepared to take that off for the kids sake? Its great go your way what's what's going on here? The contracts happening okay. Seems Parties seem to be agreeing began to agree to something important. That's the children. So children will not suffer, they will actually benefit from that agreement, if you two can really, really come to a mutual agreement to what, how we're going to take care of the children. Because the thing no matter how, in my view, no matter how people live together as a couple separate together, the contract life countries, I'm still my father to my children as a mother as much as we could only get that anger out frustration out, we can come to an agreement as to how we're going to work together and even if you don't, they don't live together. We would live for the with the kids they'd be happy. Does that make sense to you? Yes.  This is in a counseling session. And He hasn't really participated in informing his contract. But you hear that this happened for you. And you've done it. So is there something that the now you have that you can begin to negotiate with him, no matter how he is? Because there's now a new realization that the children need that. Father and Mother. How's that for you?  Yeah, maybe I just need to let him know that And just extend the invitation of having more time out there. Yeah. Yeah, you're good at that. You're very good. Who's watching you working here? You're very good at creating contracts and very clear about what you want. And it's a question of how you can the two parties can get to that agreement together. What do you think? Yeah Great, because that's, this is a rehearsal for what's going to happen.",patient feels frustrated and some compression feeling in chest and feels very tight. patient feels angry at ex husband. therapist sugest to talk to husband on an empty chair. patient wants a normal life as possible and dont want children to suffer.

Nobody wants that misery around, do they and I'd rather be on my own now.  Well I know you've you're not a doctor but you must have had thoughts about what's causing all these feelings that you thought about about these these type of things I guess I was on automatic pilot when he first left or I guess that's why I'm in the state I am now I don't know could Arizona kids I don't know but I suppose that's why I keep going down I just feel everything's useless I can't sleep. You know, what tends to bother you the most Is it the sleep or the your appetite or the energy or sleep coping with the kids asleep.

I mean, what are your thoughts about how he could help you today?  Well, I just thought with sleeping tablets I thought they might help. Would it be a good idea perhaps if we think about all the options available to you and then decide which which ones may be best for you okay. Are there any other options, we might have heard of some of the talking therapies, being able to sit down and talk with us, sort of a trained counselor about about your feelings and about what's been happening. Well, that will hekp my sleep. Well, let me be able to cope the next day to sleep. It may help you deal with some of your feelings. I take on board about the thoughts about using a sleeping tablet. I think that could be another option. Obviously, when the concerns we have is that we don't want to have you on sleeping tablets for a long period of time because their issues about becoming dependent on them and reliant on them. We can use them for a short period of time, say, for a week to help you get back into a bit more of a normal sleep.  Yeah. That sounds good to me. What's about those the two options as option the counselor, or perhaps sleeping pills? counseling, Chair counseling, I'd like I mean, I just feel if I had some sleeping tablets, I might just Just give me a spare really, and I'm quite happy with the counseling as well. Okay, so you'd like to try both. I think that that sounds a good idea. Would you be happy to the counselor here at surgery?  Yes. That'd fine Okay, so I can organize that I can speak to her and ask her to contact you to make an appointment. It also be really helpful for me as well, if you could complete one of our heads questionnaires. Most question perhaps question. Sorry. It's a short questionnaire just asking some questions about your feelings and it'll help me to find out. If there's any more help, I can give you an annex, see if that's okay. From what you've told me today, I mean, it sounds really for the last 12 months or so you've felt really low. Since split from you, your husband. Yeah. Your sleeps not being good. your appetite is not being good. I am mess is sounds to me. Self esteems taking a real not because I certainly think the help we can give you with some counts in which we have a counselor that comes here in the surgery that will be it'll be a benefit to you. And then we'll try the short course of sleep tablets to try and get you back into a state sleep pattern. Okay maybe I can see you in about two, three weeks time. And I don't want you to think that you have to sort of manage all this by yourself. I mean, that's why we're here. We're here to, to help and support you.  Yeah. Okay. Let me do the prescription then. Thank you So that's gone to reception as you can catch up on the way out. Okay. And I'll give you one of the heads question as well. Okay. Complete that before we see you next time. Okay. Thank you, doctor. Thank you for seeing me Okay, see  you next time.  Thank you. Okay, bye bye.",The patient is not sleeping well and needs to help him sleep with some sleeping tablets. She and her husband split up a year ago and since the patient was coping much.

119,"Summarize: Hi, Jessica, how are you doing?  All right. How about you? I am doing Okay. So, um, how have you been doing today? How's your week been?  It's been Okay. Um, so in our last session together, we talked about your lack of confidence. Do you feel like you might be progress on that? I mean, I've been journaling, like you said Good, good. That's been kind of helping. I feel like they're still I mean, it has improved slightly. So, when you say you've been journaling, were you able to when you had a negative thought, or you know, sometimes situation, negative thought, were you writing down a negative thought? Yeah. Not an addict. Well, mistakenly, he told me, okay, and you were able to make it a positive thought. Yeah, I mean, I tried to do that. It helped some, but is any improvements better, But I think maybe just to keep doing it. But I was more aware of how they realized how So do you remember kind of what what we discussed last time about how CBT works? Umm a little bit, Not exactly, but I just remember how my thoughts are causing things.  So would you comment review before we actually get into the session? Yeah, Yeah. Okay. So how it goes is like a cya situation or an event happens. You have a thought, Okay. And what kind of last time it was your lack of confidence? And it could be like, I'm not good enough. But that was your your thought process last time, correct?  Yeah. And then so when you have a thought you have an emotion. Last time you were saying how it made you feel bad about yourself, you felt incompetent. And then your behavior issue where you lash out at others and remain. So do you feel like that you kind of understand that?  Yeah, yeah. So I know last time I said, we talked about your lack of confidence. So for example, I know you mentioned that you also were having problems with using marijuana and depression. You had problems with depression. And you also had anger issues. And out of those, which one do you think you ought to put up to discuss today?  Probably angry. I feel like that's the biggest problem. Okay. Coming over about driver issues. I mean, it's not like I'm just like an angry person that just like snaps in any light, but I getdefensive I guess. I'm very defensive. And she lashed out, but I've never I've lashed out my child summary. It's usually always my husband can you telll me about the last time you lost your anger? we were unloading groceries, and I actually had just had my hair done and cut in color. And I was so excited. I thought he was gonna love it, you know? And he looked at it, and he of course, paid, how much money did it cost? yeah, things are kind of expensive. So total, you know, would have been $60 and he told me that, you know, we've been struggling with money. Lately a little bit, and then I didn't need to spend that much money and that selfish and Okay, so now what I'm writing down here is kind of like what we talked about how there's no family situation, you know thought and you have an emotion. So I know like what you were just saying the event or the situation was that you got your hair done and that he was angry about that. Yeah. Okay. He was yeah he was just saying mean things okay okay. Now what did you in that moment when he was being mean what was now how youfelt but what was your actual thought when he was saying all that stuff? I'm selfish. You bought them selfish, okay? Yeah. Initially Yeah, that was that was it is right. That was selfish when you actually thought selfish, guilty, guilty and sad angry, angry, very angry that he made me feel about what I was doing that way I'm going forward he said that and then once he said that,you know he put that thought in my head and it made me angry. Okay So when he when when he was getting mad at you and then telling you you're selfish and you felt substrate got yourself I'm selfish and then you got angry. What did you do after you get angry? Yeah, smack. Okay, okay. Yep There was physical contact there. Yeah, I hit him upside his head. Okay. I mean, I felt that afterwards didn't need to. It's just also mad that right? Yeah. Hey, you feel that way? Uh huh. I just lashed out. Okay. So when he when he has these, he kind of gets upset at you for certain things like this. How do you think you could change from the smacking him to having a more calm and positive response? I think if I was able to get the same thing, how do you think you might be able to do that? Umm Like, this is how we would do it with CBT we would change your thought. So what He gets upset with you and calls you selfish. You start to feel selfish. Yeah So how could you not feel selfish? Even if you changed your thought? Yeah, I mean if I never even thought that I was selfish then I would have been angry. So do you think you're selfish? Maybe the time I did die and I felt like awful but now like he says the wording for money but we're really not one might want to pay our bills or I want to do things i mean he's just kind of like a cheap person. We have plenty of money to we're not hurting at all and I do not feel confidence I don't think it was selfish to make myself feel prettier you know? But I think people do have their selfish tendencies. So I'm hearing you say is you don't think you're selfish at all. Oh, I mean, I'm Selfish actuation you don't know if you're being selfish? I really, I really don't know if I had gone and bought a whole new wardrobe with it, but man, I just did my hair. And he had pizza real estate agent. They had sold a big house that week, so we had enough money for me to afford it. Okay, so instead of thinking I'm selfish, what could you actually think? I deserve this and then how me sometimes I deserve this? Yeah. I mean, who doesn't deserve something every now and then. Right?  Yeah. Okay, so if you were thinking I deserved that. That was your thought when he was getting angry. He thought no, I'm sorry. This How do you think that would actually Make you feel what kind of emotion would you feel at that point? I drives you so confident? Yeah, confident in my decision. I would still feel real sad that paint off But I don't think it would be to the level that it was thought was selfish. So if you felt competent about your decision, because you actually changed your thought, do you think that would in turn change your behavior instead of you actually get an angry you would think there's no need for this? Yeah, I think it would help me realize that that's his issue and not mine Right. So how do you think you'd actually behave them? walk off, okay or he will  be able to  This is kind of what I'm wanting to get to, as well be able to suppress it and No, man He didn't deserve for me to hit him. He didn't. He said something that upset me, but no one deserves that. Right. So maybe I'm so thinking also that you're selfish when he's getting my back. Could you do you think maybe you could say to yourself instead of me, he just doesn't understand and maybe I need to tell him that I do deserve this. And explain it to him that this makes me feel good about myself.  Yeah, yeah, I could try that.  Because, you know, you know, you're not selfish. It's just something that makes you feel good.  And I think also, he understood why I did it. Because I mean, he knows that I have some subconscious issues, but I don't think he realizes how bad it was or why I got my hair cut encasing it as she said the most girly things you never asked me feel better about myself, you know, not be as well. Okay. Which goes back to this precedent. So Right. Okay. So do you think in like in the next coming week that you could actually change your thoughtsin targeted change how you feel? I could try yeah Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, since we talked about your angry sheets, I know you were saying last time that you were also having problems with depression and you're also having marijuana use and either one of those would you want to discuss? Or I mean, would you like to discuss your you know, your anger issues further I like to talk about the depression. Okay. What do you think triggers your depression, what makes you depressed? Umm well My son kind of at the age where he has only been involved in Why, and kind of always been the housewife And he's been he's always been my wife. You know, I did everything with him on my daughter's practices, but his mom is a boy, that is not mommy's little boy anymore. And so now he's kind of growing up and doing his own thing and then How old is your son? He's 14. Okay. So the interesting age Yeah. And so he's kind of coming in a little man who said that he probably offended but like, I don't know if that's where it comes from. honor that that's here lately. You know, I'm used to being at home and I stay with friends and I call myself a lot, or he doesn't like for me to call more. No more kisses and you know And I know that it's normal, but it still makes me feel really depressed. Okay. Okay. So the situation here is that your son doesn't want to be involved with you as much. Yeah, no, he's just grown up.  Okay And have you know, what do you think to yourself when he doesn't want to talk to mom anymore? He doesn't want to be mom. He's out doing his own thing. No, I mean like It does freak, I was checking on a football player. You're gonna believe it but bigger and bigger. And he he says taking on your dog and he got upset at me because he felt like I was getting in this business and trying to mommy you know, we're not just trying to make sure that he was going to be able to make it there on time that he had all the clothes necessary. And I asked him if he needed a rod and things like that. I just felt like I was betting in this business. And it just made me feel like I'm not needed anymore. So when you What is your exact thought though when when this stuff happens? do not feel good about it Yeah, that's hard. When you when you've always been needed before? Yeah. I fee like what kind of motion you are feeling? Like sad I was really sad. In turn, what did you What did you do in that situation?   Umm I don't know Okay. Do you think you use the marijuana also because you're pressed? Yeah.  Yeah, I've never used it before, I mean, it just started like when when I started to feel sad. So yeah.  Okay. So and what are you saying for me if I'm wrong is that, you know, your son doesn't want to be involved anymore. You don't feel like you're needed. That's what you say to yourself and that makes you feel sad and lonely. And then in turn you use marijuana. Yeah. So, you don't want to do you want to use marijuana? No, I mean, I don't want my son, If he ever found out like, I would be getting employment.  Okay, that's okay. So what what I kind of want you to do for the for the next session is kind of what we were continuing what we were doing last week, you know, how you journaled and when you have a negative thought that you changed it to a positive thought. And then in turn, you solve it like, how it could change your behavior. Yeah So do you think you could do that again? Yeah. Like when Tom such as when your son, you know, it's kind of goes along around you think instead of I'm not eating and stuff like am I eating more thinking, you know, he's growing up that's good appraised of you know, a son that is active and, and who is enjoying life? And then how does that make you feel if you actually thought to yourself?  I mean, yeah, I mean, that might make me feel better. Yeah,  you know, because he's probably in a good place and active and social one good person because of you.  Yeah. So that would make you happy I would think. And then no. Maybe then you could, you know, have a different behavior do something different.  Yeah. Okay. So journaling. Does that sound good? Yeah. I'll try",Patient have lack of confidence.

121,"Summarize: Hi Joe, How are doing today? I am alright Just alright? I mean obviously I'm not doing great I you know asked you to have this session we didn't we weren't scheduled for today. I just I don't know I just I'm feeling you know, depressed as usual but it's just it's stronger and I'm just feeling I just don't want to wake up I just rough time of things? Yeah what was causing it? Not really. I mean, it's just the same except one You know, like, I just I feel like what's the point? I don't feel like continuing on. You don't feel like continuing with your life. Yeah, kind of Have you been having thoughts of suicide? I mean, I think about what it would be like to just end things. I think it would be a lot easier. But at the same time, like, I can't imagine doing it. But you know, I can't say I haven't thought about it.  So you have some thoughts about it, what prevents you from doing it? I don't know. I mean, I guess I know what it would be like for my family. I don't want to hurt them. They would be hurt? Yes and it's scary, I mean, the thought of dying is scary, but the thought of going on is painful. So it almost sounds as if by squaring it down a bit. Yeah, I kind of feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Like I just don't know where to go from here. Have you worked out in a specific plan or so? No, I mean, you know, you know, I thought like if I were to do it, you know, ways but not not specific because I just don't think that I could do it, you know, like, I don't. I thought about suicide, but I don't like, seriously consider it as an option. But it's starting to like creep into my thoughts. And it never has before so that I'm like, kind of concerned about that. Like, I guess I know. Sometimes people like really planted and but for me, I've it's an I've never really considered it before so it's really scaryfor me.  So, this how long been going on this feelings? Um, I think like in the past couple of days, it started you know, more so and then like today, it was just like the first thought in my head and I couldn't stop thinking about it and that's why I wanted to see you because I'm just feeling I'm starting to feel like a little bit out of control. Okay, so and today and maybe the past few days been kind of new feeling that a new thought you don't want to continue life continue living. But at the same time, you don't want to commit suicide. You don't have a plan. Yeah, I don't want to I, I really don't want to but, you know, like I said, I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place like it. It's not, I know it's not a good option. I just like Sometimes I feel like I'm so stuck. I just don't know where else to go. So if, we'll call it feeling depression, right, because that's what we've talked about before, is the depression will go away? Do you think that would change your outlook on? Definitely, I think that is like the reason why I, the reason why the thought of not living anymore comes into my head is because of my depression because I just feel so like, my emotions are out of control, because I wake up feeling so down and so useless and pointless, that it makes me wish that I was dead. But if I didn't have that feeling, then I wouldn't wish that I was dead. Because I know that my life has value and I know that my family would want me around and I know there's a future for me, but my feelings make me feel like my future is just dark and pointless Alright these suicidal ideations I know you're, you're telling me you haven't had them before, so I can appreciate that they're scary. They could be scary, even if you hadn't had them before, are fairly common with depression. And you've, it sounds like what you're really saying is you're frustrated, and you're tired of being sick. And I think that you make a valid point when you say your family would be upset if you happen to regularly talk about your family before and it would seem to be very upset. When I see your life has value. I want to try to hang on to that thought. After we're done here today, tell me what you have planned for us today. Well, I didn't I didn't really have plans because I kind of you know, came here feeling like I really needed to see you so I kind of put things on hold but I mean, I guess I would go home and, and, you know, I'm not really sure.  Anywhere else you will go? No. But, I mean, I probably could go to my parents house if I needed to, I could probably call them in and see, you know, it's getting close to the afternoon so they get off work soon. Can you do that for me? Can you go there? Yeah, I think that's a good idea. And we'll kind of play by here from that point. I'm going to see you today. We'll we'll do some work today. Well, I'll see you again tomorrow. All right. So if you could spend a night there that that would be a wiser choice, given your thoughts and your feelings right now. Have you ever haven't used the term contract for safety? I think you mentioned it before. I'm not really sure. Okay. So what it means is you kind of an only if it's authentic, I want this to be true is kind of where you promised me that you're going to be safe until I see you again, right for the foreseeable future that you don't have any intent or plan to harm yourself. Can you make that promise to me now?  Yeah Okay. All right. So give me a minute and I'll come back and overcome a bit today. And now I'm going to schedule you see tomorrow as well. yeah. okay Thank you. Thanks, Joe.","Patient thought about suicide, but don't like, seriously consider it as an option.

122,"Summarize: Hi Jill, How ar your doing today ? I am doing all right doing all right? Yeah, I'm feeling a little bit, I'm feeling a little bit better, a little better and even down for a while what's going on? I just feel like everything's gonna be okay. This is unusual for you because usually, when I come in, you come in and talk to me cut down or depressed, something changed recently. I just I feel like I found the solution and I just, I know what I'm going to do. So I don't, I'm not really worried about my depression. So I guess I'm feeling a little bit better about it.  Can you tell me about the solution you found for your question? Yeah, I you know, I know. We've talked Before I think that I'm gonna that I am gonna commit suicide. You want to commit suicide? You know how you'd do that? Yeah, I have some pills in my house in the medicine cabinet, and I'm going to take those. When do you plan on doing this? Probably a couple days from now. I have some things to get an order. I want to, you know, arrange things and make sure that, you know, everything's in order and then, and then I'll do it. What kind of things to to arrange? Um, you know, I want to make sure that all the documents my husband's going to need that they're in a place that he can find them. Not going to tell him but I want you know, I don't want to make things more difficult for him and just that kind of thing. You know what I mean? Like, make sure that everything's in order so that when I'm gone, everybody has what they need. So Jill, you've been seeing me for almost a year now and you know, by telling me this, that I'm gonna act to stop you. But I'm gonna try to stop you from killing yourself.  Mm hmm. Yeah, I mean, I want to do it. I think in the end, it's, it's what's going to make things better. But I guess there's still a part of me that doesn't want to die doesn't want to do that to my family. So I guess I'm telling you, because you know, I'm not 100% resolved, and I guess I wanted to talk it over. You seem pretty serious, though, about your timetable in your plan. Yeah. I mean, you know, it's like, when you plan to go on a weekend trip, you're pretty sure you're going to go but if the weather's bad, you might not so I think, you know, I'm pretty sure. Is there anything that can stop you? Um, I don't know. I don't. I think I mean, I feel pretty sure about it. Do you feel like it's the depression or something else that drove you to this decision? I feel like I feel like, um, it's just, you know, the same old things that I was worried about before, you know, the depression and, and, you know, my relational issues my job, like the stuff that, that gets me down, and, you know, it just clicked and it was like, you know, I've thought about it before, but like, I I feel like I'm gonna feel better. I feel like it's just gonna, it's gonna, I'm gonna feel better so. as you said, it's a solution.  Yeah I know we've, we've talked about this issue in the past, right? And when you've come in feeling this way, kind of resolved harming yourself. We sent you over to the hospital. I know that's not your favorite place. But when you go there for however long it's been usually what five days come out feeling a lot better.  Yeah. Do you feel like this time would be different? Well, I feel like in the past, you know, I've I've been thinking about killing myself seriously, but now, I'm not as scared of it. So I don't really want you to put me in the hospital because then I won't be able to do it. And before I was scared, so I wanted you to put me in the hospital. But now I just want to get it over with and so I really don't want you to do that. So like I say, a part of you saying that. You don't want me to stop you. But yeah, you came in here and you told me, so part of you seems to you maybe not quite sure. So like I say, a part of you saying that. You don't want me to stop you. But yeah, you came in here and you told me, so part of you seems to you maybe not quite sure. hasn it helped you gaining clarity? I don't know, I guess. I guess I see that you're saying that like, I really need to go to the hospital. I guess I was hoping a little bit that you would be happy for me that I was feeling better. But I think that you want me to go to the hospital. So I don't know. It makes me think about whether it's the right decision. You know, mean a suicide? Yeah. Sometimes and you know, you've been with me, like I said about almost a year now and you've been depressed much that time. And it's not unusual. When somebody thinks they found a solution to depression, even if that solution something that I am against, like suicide, that their their mood would become elevated because you see an end to pain. There's other things we can do and have done the past, try to get you out of pain.  But we have done them in the past and I didn't feel better and now I am feeling better. So you know I I just want you to accept that. But I'm not going to it's my obligation with it I'm happy to fulfill to try to keep you alive. I've seen you this way before and I know it may not seem this way now but when you came out from a suicidal thoughts and feelings you did well for weeks, sometimes months at a time. You're seeing really just the darkest when you're in the  Yeah, but I'm feeling better now. Temporarily, because you feel you found the end to the pain which I understand. I mean, Understand you feeling better, but you're feeling better because you plan on killing yourself. And we've talked about how devastating that would be to your family, right? your friends. I am torturing them with my sadness, I'm just making their lives miserable. I don't understand how it's gonna help them for me to stay alive. You know, I'm worth more, they can have my life insurance. And, you know, I won't make them suffer anymore. So your logic is that if you end your life, you'll freed them from having to deal with Yeah. And feels like the right thing to do And as you know, I mean, you've signed releases, I've talked to your husband, your parents, they've repeatedly said that, despite sometimes the challenge of dealing with depression, they would much rather Have you alive, Why would they say that? I think that they're scared of the pain of losing me, but I know that they'll feel better eventually. So they'll feel good over the grief?  Yeah, I understand. And I think that they'll understand that I needed this. You know, I've been doing this for a while. Right. I think we've come to have a good relationship.  Yeah. And I would hope that I've earned your trust and you value my opinion. We'll do something that I know about suicide. You open  to hearing it? Yeah There's a lot of ways that people die. Right. And it's, it's really what eventually will happen to us all. It's hard for me to imagine way more devastating than suicide. Meaning when somebody dies of an illness, or a car accident or any other type of tragic accident, people grieve, right? But there's usually not a blame assigned to that mean they don't feel guilty. Does that make sense?  Yeah They feel sad because they've lost the person, but they don't feel responsible for that person's death. Suicide is different, when somebody commits suicide, their family and friends feel responsible. They have no answers to all the questions that they have. They could never get an answer. I'm gonna write them a note and tell them everything and tell them it's not their fault because it's not their fault and I just want them to be happy without me. So you believe the note will take away all that pain? No, but I think that it will help them realize that they shouldn't feel guilty, like you're saying it'll mitigate that pain? Yeah. Okay. I can tell you from experience that notes, notes don't really help. If anything, it's another artifact that they can agonize over. I know it's hard to see from your perspective, because you're kind of resolved to this and you feel stuck in the pain you want now, but they will miss you and they will agonize for the rest of their lives, because they've lost you. And it's a it's a special horrible type of agony that comes with feeling responsible for causing someone's death. I know you don't want that. I just don't know why you can't let me feel better. I know it's frustrating. I know it's hard to understand. The times when you've gone to the hospital before, you have felt better. Your outlook was completely different, not 100%. But it was completely different when you came out. I mean, you're still a little down, but nowhere near the depression we'd want to hurt yourself. Is it possible if you go to the hospital this time, you could come out feeling better again? yeah, It's possible. I'm gonna make arrangements to get you out of the hospital. I know. I know you don't. And we've had this conversation before. Right? I realized that, you know, you're not happy with some of the conditions there. But you usually talk finally about the groups. Right? You usually do well in the groups. And typically, well, every time right, every time you've been in the hospital, you've come out feeling better. I know it's not what you want to hear. I know you want me to be happy that you're gonna enjoy life, but that would make me happy. That would make anybody happy. I know you think it would make you happy. But I can tell you it's not the answer. I'd like you to go voluntarily through this process. Will you do that? Ok Lets go All right. I'll go make those arrangements and we can show you. Okay? okay.","this is a classic love story between a woman and a man . it is more about the passage of time. patient feels the same old things that I was worried about before, you know, the depression and, and, you know, my relational issues my job. therapist knows, patient signed releases, therapist talked to husband, parents of patient, they've repeatedly said that, despite sometimes the challenge of dealing with depression, they would much rather Have you alive,"

And our goal is to try to make things see how we can make things a little bit easier for you. Okay, and at school, I feel like they're not doing anything. They're not listening to me about my feelings.  So you feel pretty unheard. I feel unheard at school. My parents and my sister are hearing so you said you've been feeling pretty sad.

Thank you.  Okay, so on this list it says about sort of what medical illnesses he's had and hospitalizations and surgeries as well. So there's a couple of treatments for for depression. One is medication and one is also doing some interventions within the school and within the family. And there's a lot of things to think about, but it seems like things in the school have been really not going well. And that's been a major contribution to his to sadness.","Patient did not come to psychiatrist, his mom and dad and sister drove him here. patient didn't want to come.

Patient is sad for couple of months. Therapist discussed the situation with patient and his sister."
125,"Summarize: Hey Michelle, how are you doing today? Umm I am kind of doing, I'm feeling a little bit stressed out stressed? Yeah, I feel like I have a lot on my plate. I have this test that I have to take for work. What kind of test? It's like an aptitude test. It has like math problems on it and like scenarios in order for me to move up to the system manager position. Now, that's a job that you've been interested in for a while. Yes. Yes. So I've been just feeling a lot of anxiety about taking the test and then they actually scheduled for me to take the test. And I want and I just got really overwhelmed. And I started like I felt my heart was racing. I felt like I wish my hands were shaking. And I just really couldn't concentrate on the test. Even though the night before me and my friend that practice problems, and I knew all the answers with no proper like, I didn't miss any of the questions so you know the material on this test pretty well? yes. But the feelings and that the physiological response to heart rate and sweating, that feelings of anxiety plus those physiological responses they got in the way of you completing it, like you were unable to complete it. No, I wasn't able to complete it. And thankfully, they gave me a chance to come back. I just told him I didn't feel well. So they rescheduled so now I'm feeling a lot of anxiety because I'm scared the same thing is gonna happe, when I go back. So you weren't you weren't feeling great about taking the test in the first place? Today, the night before, I felt like I know all the answers, but the minute I walked into the room, all of a sudden, all these fears kind of took over.  But did you know that was coming? Yes,  you did ?Okay. Yes. So you had some anxiety in advance? Yes,  or no, you did. Okay. I had some anxiety the day before. But when I reviewed it with my friend, I'm like, Oh, I know the answers. I thought that would kind of push it down. But I think once I got there, it all came back up to the surface, erupt in that moment, and that prevented you. What do you think is leading to this? Well, I've always kind of struggled with tests. I'm like, I can remember when I was in third grade, I had to take this test, because I was really struggling in math. And I had to pass this test in order to move to the next grade. And I thought just like this test that I was ready for it, I had a tutor, and I felt really prepared for it. And then when I took it, I failed. And I was held back. And I feel like, you know, that was so it was, it was really embarrassing for me to be held back. And I felt like I don't want to say but I did feel like a failure at the time. Because I felt like I really didn't know this. I don't know why I couldn't pass the test. And since that this was third grade. Yeah. And since that bad testing experience. Have you had trouble with tests since? Yes, I always feel really anxious. I mean, I'm able to pass tests obviously because I graduated from college. School went on to high school. But it's so hard for me because of this anxiety that I feel that even though I may think I know it, I may still fail the test anyway, maybe like a repeat of what happened. Alright, so in third and third grade, you had a really bad testing experience. And as you move forward from there, you've never really been thrilled about taking tests  no But you've been able to adapt. You've been able to take them and still, like pass them. Yeah, I mean, sometimes I get an A.  So that's, that's good, right?  Yeah. I mean, yeah, it is good. Yeah, it's good. But this particular test, which is not for scorches for work, yeah, this one, this is more of a stumbling block for you. Yes. You have any ideas as to what may what may be what may be making this test such a point of anxiety for you? I think it's just the fact that it's this promotion. So it's like the same thing. Like, if I fail, I'm being held back. And I feel like it's, we live in that moment of being held back. And that, that that's like a fear that I have that, um, that by not being able to pass these tests are holding me back. So it really that same feeling you've had in third grade. That's coming up with this test. Yeah, I mean, I didn't put them together until now. But yeah. And the other test you take in throughout the rest of grade school in high school they didn't, they didn't have that same value attached to them. Now because they didn't have all that pressure that it was either win win or lose, basically,  you could, you could take them again or take the course again or? or I could take another test to raise the grade if I didn't do good on that. so you have you maybe had more options in school? Yes. Was it fail, you know, pass or fail? Right, So it's the, it's the pressure is the pressure of you need to get through this. And you don't have the safety nets that you had in school?  Yeah, if I fail it, then I'm not going to be able to get the promotion, I would have to wait. Just like I did not have to wait a certain amount of time. I think an ear before I could take it again. So this a lot of pressure. Yeah it is So is there any time limit to this test for work? Um, no, there isn't. There's no time. No How many Is it like a, like a multiple choice?  Yes, it is.  Okay. And you seem like, like you said, you said the night before with your friend.  Yeah. You're really well prepared for it. Yes. So I have a few a few thoughts about this. One is I'm wondering you know, we've talked before about cognitive therapy core beliefs. So I'm curious as to what you think about what core beliefs may be operating. For you now with this with this test, this work test that  I could fail that if I fail I could end up being a failure at all, you know, the things that I try something like, I am a failure or I'm bound to be a failure, I'm destined to be a failure.  I would say like I'm destined to be. Okay, so  destined to be failure. So that, so that, potentially, is a core belief. Right? That's, that's operating. I mean, that's what scares me. That's, that's exactly the thought that I'm thinking when I'm about to take the test. And if I don't pass that, it's just gonna have like this domino effect of failure. Okay, so it could be a core belief, but it's also seems like you're still on that thought. Like as you get ready to take that test. You're thinking I'm just destined to be a failure.  Yeah. And you're having what sounds like a panic response to heart racing. Yeah, my hands shaking.  Are you in the room alone? You're taking the test? Yes,  you are. So no one's really seeing you have this. I wouldn't want to call it a panic attack yet we haven't really gotten too far into it. But it sounds like it has some panic like features. Yeah. Because it's not. It's interfering with you thinking clearly enough to get to the items. So, okay. So one thought I have is you have you ever had panic attacks in the past or anything like this?, the third grade thing? No, not really. I mean, sometimes I get worked out when I'm about to take a test, okay, but it's only around test. And what happens once you get worked up like once your heart rate increases and You have any other physiological symptoms would want to actually do take the test? hmmm Um, I kind of try to work through it and start trying to answer one question at a time to get to the last question. So one one possible strategy here is we talked about the adaptive response. Right? So, which is that thought that you say to yourself that self talk, I wonder if your doctor response couldn't be I can ride this out like you have no time to test?  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, the panic responses only maintained for so long and I could also choose like maybe questions that are no the answer to automatically so that could help maybe release some of that stress to get some in a sense to get some minor victories under your belt by like, answering those right you know, you're closer to achieving your goal yes and then I feel like I know, at least I know that like, Don't validate the feeling that I maybe I can pass this test. So the more items you you answer correctly, the less anxious you're gonna feel because you're closer to the end of. Yeah, definitely. Because then I start to feel more calm because I know that I know these questions are definitely going to be right. So that's so that's one well, that's a cognitive and behavioral strategy, right? Like you can you can wait out the panic. I mean, you're in the room alone. Yeah, that's true. Nobody's there. Nobody's gonna see me. I'm kind of trying to get myself together.  Yeah. Now the panic painful. Right, the you know, the panic symptoms are painful. So what you could tell yourself is, this isn't pleasant. But I can write out these symptoms because they only last so long.  Probabiy, I could use like self talk.  Exactly. Yeah, because usually mean peg symptoms can run you know, five minutes. 10 minutes, 15 minutes. But you have no time limit?  Yeah, yeah so if you can just kind of use that time to focus on the items, as you mentioned, you could get right. And kind of, at the same time be telling yourself I can ride this out. Yeah, I mean, I've done that in the past, so I can apply it to this test.  So if that's worked for you that ? yes, that has worked and I passed.  So that's, that's certainly that's certainly one adaptive response to try writing. Another one could be that, although it wouldn't be great to fail, you can retake the test in a year. Right. You could try it.  Yeah, that's true. I mean, I know that's not what you want, but, but the alternative is kind of buying into that automatic thought we know that's not working. Right. The I'm I'm Destin, that was the word right like I'm destined to be a failure. We know that's not working for you.  So even if I have to take the test again and in a year, then I'm not going to be a failure because I still have the chance to take it again. It's not like I'll never be able to take this test again. Yeah, you just have, you just have another years of study, right? And, of course, you wouldn't have that promotion that time and that would be an outcome, I know you don't want. But it's not the end of your career, It's not like something so drastic it's important to you and I can appreciate that. But it's not the end of your career. You're not going to be unemployed. No, no, definitely not. And just thinking back and relating it back to the third grade, even though I had to stay back. I still managed to, you know, do well the next year and keep moving up. And it hasn't really, in the long run prevented me from doing anything that I've wanted to do. So that's great. That's another adaptive response, which you've survived this before. Yes, I definitely have. So this one event, I mean, I had the the incident third grade with the unpleasant experience but this one event you don't want that this kind of fashion. While use your word, your destiny by like this was one that seemed to catch you off guard but the the panic like symptoms. And fortunately your employer is going to give you the chance to retake and try this again. And, and I met you know, so you have I imagine you could you can write out these, these symptoms. And I think you have the other adaptive response, which is I've been successful this before. Yeah. I mean, definitely I feel a lot better now because I just know that no matter what happens, I've been here before, and I can get through it as opposed to like that feeling that I'm going to just fail together. Oh, it's so good, when you have to take the test? on next week. So let's schedule one more appointment right before that. Okay, right.  And we'll, we'll make sure that you have these adaptive responses down and you're ready to go. Okay. And really will kind of focus on the positive outcome. Right. Okay, which is just taking this test taking one item at a time and fighting through some of these physical symptoms you're having, and fighting through the useful thoughts. Okay. Yeah, I mean, that sounds good. That helped me prepare for the test.  Great. So, Michelle, I'll see you. I'll see you then and work through it. I really appreciate you coming in today.",Patient is feeling a lot of anxiety when they actually scheduled for patient to take the test.

126,"Summarize: So, good to see you again. Last week we're talking about anxiety. Do you have your diary card?  Yeah. Okay, let's look at it real quick. Bring it over here. Yeah Okay, so anxiety is really high. What happened yesterday anxiety is really high can be quick summary anxiety is always really high. But yesterday was the worst. why? We were driving. My dad was driving and I was in the passenger seat and we were in a lot of traffic and that, you know, that already makes me nervous. I like to be on time. I know I don't want to be late because then what if I get in trouble. So it's already kind of on edge. And then we passed the accident that I guess was causing off the traffic. And there were two cars and they were like, mashed together like accordions, and there was a tarp. And I know that under that tarp, there was a dead body, and the car went right. by it.  That's scary. This horrible kind of explains that number. Hmm ? yeah. Who wouldn't be anxious? That's like a normal thing because there's a dead body. Well, I'd be anxious Of course. And it's kind of scary to see that. And what else did you think when you saw that? Who would drive when there's two cars mash together like accordions on a dead body? That's insane. You have to be insane to drive. And your family wants you to learn to drive this year because you're 16 they're insane. And yet, you all you you keep complaining how you live in the middle of nowhere. And if you had a car you could like, go see friends more and get out of your lame Old Town and get to go do fun things.  I can't see my friends anymore if I'm dead. True. That's true. And I won't get to see you anymore. Because you're dead. You know, I don't treat dead people right. Remember that? Yeah, okay. So on one hand, I know the idea of driving is completely overwhelming. And I know you're anxious, like all the time. And I get that I have to drive because you're right. It's like the middle of nowhere. And I can't just, like, not go places, but  so I'm wondering if we can bring it back to some of those things you're talking about to help reduce your anxiety. Maybe that's one idea to help you be able to get in the driver's seat. What do you think? So, essentially, you're practicing getting the driver seat by like doing this treatment and get in the driver's seat of your anxiety, as opposed to being a passenger and you're letting anxiety outside really your life? Because that's what you're doing. What do you think? There's a lot of puns, Jen. I'm punning ain't I? So, here's an idea. Let's get on board. We start treating this anxiety. We do it really, really good. job at it we work hard. And idea driving might not be quite as scary. And let's face it being anxious driver increases your risk accidents.  Well, that's helpful. Thanks.  So reducing your anxiety, It's gonna make you a safer driver. Yeah, but all these things you keep telling me that I have to do to be less anxious. They involve like feeling really anxious.  True. there's no way to like can't you're supposed to like just make it go away. You're not supposed to make it worse to make it better. So here's what's interesting. You're really good at being really anxious. So you'll be really good at this. And it will go away. I promise you, I totally promise you.  That's soo hard. You know, done well, I'm the expert here of treating anxiety, and I promise you it will get better. I know everything. I know this. What do you think? I think it sounds really hard. It's really hard. All I do is totally, totally hard. Maybe it's just not there. Same thing that you have to be more anxious to be less anxious. I know. It isn't. It's pretty insane, isn't it? I agree. Well, another option is you could just be anxious the rest of your life. Do they have a bus where you live?  No,  you know that live with your parents for the rest of your life. I know I forgot. So you can live with your parents for the rest of your life. Because you're too anxious to leave town you won't be able to drive. So you could just live with your parents be anxious all the time, and you could go home so ideas on how to maintain your anxiety the rest of your life. You won't need to learn to drive. I mean, your parents are fairly nice. They probably drive around for the rest of your life, you know, until they pass away or something. In the meantime, what about that? So forget the whole treatment. I'm pushing you too hard. Why don't we just talk about how to maintain your anxiety? You're good at it.  Jenna's  thats not funny. It's not meant to be funny. What do you think ?  that's horrible,  I really want to help you. I know being anxious every time Really hard. So one of the options is to really become good at being anxious, and do okay, and learn to sit with your anxiety. And another option is Yeah, getting more anxious to reduce your anxiety.  So you're saying that no matter what I choose, it's going to involve feeling anxious.  Yeah. For your practice at it. Well, I mean, if those are the only options, might as well do the one that's gonna make it eventually go away rather than just be there forever. All right. Do you want to review what some of the treatment strategies will be? Yeah, I guess.  Okay, let's do that.","What happened yesterday anxiety is really high can be quick summary anxiety is always really high. Yesterday was the worst. We were driving.

127,"Summarize: Hi Kylie, How are you doing today? I'm doing all right. not doing too bad.  How are you doing Dr. Grande ? Not bad. Thanks for asking. What brings you in? Um, so my girlfriend saw your ad in the paper. And she saw like out of some of the things that you work on one of them is smoking cessation and it bothers her that I smoke. Um, so she has been nagging me for like weeks to come in and talk to you. So I figured I would just kind of come in just so she would stop bugging me about it. So you came into therapy today? Because your girlfriend pressured you? Yeah, I mean, it's just it's easier for me like if I come in here and talk to you like That's it.

There's like so many good things about smoking. I get one what really got me into it was I smoke a lot at work because it gives me like one on one time with the boss. So like the fact that I can get that time with my boss is make worth it.  Can you tell us some of the not so good things about smoking? Um, I it's just a, it's how I meet people. So like, if I like, I'll have cigarettes on me, but like, I don't have a lighter and that kind of like keeps me from finishing off the pack. Because I can finish off a pack a day. But if I don't have a lighter than, like, I carry the cigarettes around with me. And then if I see other people are smoking, I can go and ask for a lighter and that's always kind of went away and to get to these groups and I've just met so many different people from from smoking like So smoking, the way you're presenting it, there's been a positive thing in your life ? Yeah, I mean, like I only do it socially. So that's Yeah. Are there any negative aspects to smoking? I mean, yeah, I mean, everyone, everyone knows smoking is unhealthy. But like I don't, I don't smoke a lot. Like I only only smoke from time to time and it's mostly just on the weekends. So it's like, I don't know, occasionally I go by smoker for the weekends, I might have like a cough. Maybe I get like a heavy cough on Mondays Tuesdays, part of me is gone by Wednesday. So it's not really that big of a deal. So you don't seem like you're too worried about the negative aspects ? Now. I mean, like the obviously is unhealthy. But like one of the things I'm trying to do in my life now is get out there and meet new people and like the benefit of being able to do that smoking is better than like giving it up for health reasons. I think. So I wanna ask you a question. I want you to give a response between one and 10 as is called scaling And it's to do with the importance of stopping smoking. So one would be, it's not important to, and 10 would be, it's extremely important to you, where do you think you'd put that number?  I don't know. Maybe like, like a two. like it'd be cool to get rid of the cough on Mondays but that getting rid of that is not worth everything else I get from smoking. So not particularly important? Yeah Now, let me ask you the same question except instead of importance, how confident are you about confidence? How confident are you that you could quit smoking on a scale of one sound one being not confident all and 10 being extremely confident. I could say probably like an eight or nine like I could I could give it up actually I gave it up recently like for like a month and I didn't even crave it but eventually like just seeing all my friends got smoking like I missed that. So I just started off again, but I don't know if I like if I really wanted to give it up. Forget I'm sure I could So stopping smoking is not important to you, but you're fairly confident you could if you decided to quit. So, based on kind of where you are in terms of it doesn't seem like you're interested in stopping smoking, what would be a goal? How could we spend this time so that it would be productive? I don't know. Like, I guess it would It would help to be able to, like explain to my girlfriend that like the stuff that I get from smoking and like you You seem you kind of seem like you get it so like, I don't know, maybe figure out ways to like explain to her the things that I get from smoking to like, I don't know just kind of help her like realize why I do it other than just to kill myself. So to help her to understand why smoking works for you. Yeah. That's that's one goal than any other goals you could think of I mean, you came in, in part because you're well, that seemed to appear like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured you.  Yeah. So any other relational goals you might want to work on there? Well, no, we haven't really been like we've been fighting a lot because of the smoking. So I think like, maybe figuring out ways like to maybe communicate better or like having like good fights in a way like I don't ascribe that but like having fights that are productive like that just don't always end like with us just like going our separate ways or like one of us leaving the house but like, I guess being able to like wrap up a fight so it doesn't last for like days. So productive communication and productive arguments right yeah, yeah.  So so one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantages of smoking to your girlfriend. Right She understands how important it is to you Yeah. Because it does seem like it's really important to you. But another would be to work on your relation, your relational style, so that you, you can end argument and feel like you're not at a stalemate? right Yeah, yeah, I think that'd be cool.  All right. Well, you want to make those two goals. We work one so we can spend this time going up too fast.  Yeah, I can do it that it's kind of like killing two birds with one stone. Does that make sense to me. Well, that's what we'll do. So what I'd like to do, I'll see you again and about a week.  Right, right.  So if you could reflect on some of these changes you think you can make with this relationship where you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator. Because a lot of this revolves around communication. yeah communicating the advantages of smoking, but also communicating in the arguing, so that you have productive end to these arguments, right. So it's really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have a positive result.  Yeah. Yeah, that'd be cool. We can do that.  Okay. So if you could work on kind of thinking that through, and then next time we meet, we'll talk about those different goals and maybe ways to make some small changes in that relationship to to meet those goals.  Right. All right. Sounds good. All right. Thanks for coming in Kylie. Thank you.","smoking can be bad, but it doesn't it's never bothered me like I don't know. I get one what really got me into it was I smoke a lot at work because it gives me like one on one time with the boss. I can finish off a pack a day. Because I can finish off a pack a day. Because I can finish off a pack a day. But if I don't have a lighter than, like, I carry the cigarettes around with me ."
128,"Summarize: Hi Ann, How are you doing today ?  I guess I'm okay. How are you? I'm well, thanks for asking. So you sau you doing okay, what's going on? I'm definitely no better than last week. When we talked. I mean, it's been I had some major binges this week. and I don't even honestly know why we're bothering to talk about it. Because I've been down this road before. Umm hmm I should just, I should just like give up and buy some momos and, you know, just resign myself to the pack. I'm going to get fat and I'm going to stay bad. Tell me about some of the foods that you've been eating that have been kind of leading to this problem for you. brownies, brownies, brownies, brownies. And well, that's what got it started. You know, I was great the first half of the week and of staying away from the sugar away from the flour. I signed a stay at home from school, you know, hurt his head. He wanted to bake brownies with my son. Okay, let's bake brownies. So then we eat the whole pan and we bake two more pans. And then it didn't just stay the brownies, you know? Went out like hamburgers, french fries, candy, you know, stopped in wah wah on the way up. It's disgusting. I can't I didn't want to tell you how Because it's disgusting, and the clothes aren't fitting. It's just really, really sad. You've had a rough week ? Yeah. So, let's talk about for a second. I'd like to the kind of your relationship to this problem. How do you how do you view this problem? It's disgusting. It's like it's slavery. Food owns me. So the so the food is in control of this situation? sounds ridiculous when you say it like that, but that's what it is. It's in control ? Yeah Alright. So, now I want to ask you a couple of questions about the importance and the confidence of changing clearly, you have some desire to change or we wouldn't be be here.  Oh my god, I would love to Yeah. So if you're looking at a scale of one to 10, one was, it's not important to change and 10 was extremely important change. This is just how important it is for you to curtail your eating 10 times very important to you. Yeah, it's very important very important. Okay. So what if I asked the same question except this time? You're confidence. So, one is you're not confident, all you can change, but 10 you're very confident you could change. I could probably change for half a day. I've done it. And sometimes if I'm lucky, I'll get a week. But overall? overall  yeah it's impossible. Like you want a number at zero. So it's below the below the scale of one to 10 this is Yeah so you can have no confidence at all. I've tried it. I know. I mean, it's like beating my head against the wall. So, on one hand you'd like to, you'd like to stop the eating, It's important to but on the other hand, you don't believe you can do it.  I can't do it. You can't do it? I can't. it can't be done. Have there been any other changes you have been able to make, say in the last few years that have been positive. I stopped biting my nails. So you had some small successes in terms of making changes. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think makes the this thought I'll just refer to as the food problem so much more powerful ? So much more difficult to tackle? I wish I know. I mean, there's so many things it's it's everywhere. The food is everywhere? It is everywhere. I mean You mentioned before that brownies were the culprit for this last week. brownies, Hershey bars, Hershey Kisses, Yeah, chocolate. You enjoy chocolate? Yeah. Okay. How about other foods that could be contributing the problem? Maybe you don't enjoy as much as chocolate.  Oh, potato chips. French fries. Mexican food. What else? Cheese? Definitely any of the types of candies ? start naming Skittles, cherry Starburst basically any candy. Pretty much any candy? Yeah. So of the candy, so I want to focus just on the candies. Okay, and not to the foods just for now. The thought of like I introduced the idea of stopping eating chocolate. How would you react to that?  Not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen?  All right, I would love for it to happen. right, But that's not gonna happen ? I can just tell you I don't even want to pretend. So you know that for sure. How about the let's, let's go, for example with the Skittles. What if I introduce the idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles? Just the Candy Skittles ? Just Just that one candy. Yeah. Why bother that? Like, can I not eat Skittles? Is that what you're saying? Like, you could. It's up to you whether or not but if I introduced that idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles, how would you react to that? I don't really understand why. Well, it represents a change in the direction that you want to move. But if I stopped eating Skittles, I'm still going to eat brownies I'm still going to eat. Yeah, we know we know that scenario that you know, you can't really make a change right now from what you're saying. Like that's the idea of stuffing chocolate is not going over well, with you no, it's not gonna happen. and that's fine. But the idea of stopping Skittles Its fine. that doesn't seem as daunting? No. Would you agree still on, say the 110 scale that it's important to stop Skittles? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. How confident are you you could not eat  ? it's kind of funny now you're talking about it, I've sort of wants Skittles more. But, you know, I like from now till next week when I come in here, I'd say like I am 99% confident I could not eat Skittles and it would not be a major problem. So this is a change that you think you could accomplish. Yeah Even though you're not sure it'll actually contribute to solving the larger problem. We know that that's something that that's an area where you don't really see a change as as likely If I don't eat Skittles, this week or even for the rest of my life, is it going to solve my problem? No, but will I do it? If that's what you want me to do? Yeah, that's fine. Well, I would hope it's something that that you would want to do. I mean, what I want is one thing, what you want is really important here. Is this something that mean your Skittles, part of the problem?  Yeah,  small? Yeah Alrigh. No pun intended, right. But it's a small part of the problem, but you'd agree it's still part of the problem.  Yeah, sure. Not a huge change. But it's one that we can work on. Alright And we want you to be able to, you know, genuinely buy into the goal. I mean, if you don't think it's important, we can talk about other areas of change. No, I guess I see what you're saying. I mean, if I'm gonna be completely honest with you, I Well, that's what I'm paying you for. Right? So I don't think it's gonna work. I'll just tell you that  right. You think you could stop eating Skittles, but you don't think it's gonna solve the larger problem or lead to? Exactly. But that's what we have to work with right now. Because the larger problem is not something you mean the way you put it is it has control. Yeah. Yeah. So if I introduced the idea of stopping brownies,  no, no, no, sorry. So let's let's go after the change that we can achieve in this case. You know, it's not perfect. It's not ideal, but it's what you can do. you saw the plan so suffer  so for this week so you can week for this week just Just continue eating Skittles.  Now Skittles alright  And let's see, let's see how we do with that change. So that seemed to make sense. Yeah. So work with that and I'll see you again week. Thanks. Thank you",Patient started when she ate brownies. Food is in control of patient's situation. It's disgusting and like it's slavery. Food owns patient. It's important for patient to curtail eating 10 times.
129,"Summarize: So you made your bed. That's great. really makes a difference. How did waking up earlier ago? Well, it worked for like a day or two, but then the power went out.

130,"Summarize: Hi, Miss Jones.  Yes I'm Jane Corona. I'm a medical student with university here Nice to meet you I've been sitting by Dr. Smith is part of our treating as a medical student to do an interview with you. Okay. And then I'll take that information back to Dr. Smith And then she will come back in and see you then after that okay. All right. How may I address you? Mrs. Jones is fine. All right. Thank you. Um, is that okay with you today to talk? Yes. Okay, fine, thank you. I'm going to start out today by just talking a little bit with you about your chief complaint What brings you here today? Sure, my left elbow is actually been bugging me a lot. Every once in a while, I've been getting a little bit of pain, extending my arm and going back to bending it. Really, that's the primary reason I've come in I've attempted to take a little bit To Tylenol to relieve the pain but it's not really seemed to help much.  Okay, before we talk a little bit more about that, is there anything else that you want to talk with either me or Dr. Smith today? Not that I can think of no. Okay. Tell me more about this pain. Um, it's just kind of a throbbing pain, it'll act up kind of randomly throughout the day. It doesn't it's not specific to, you know, the morning or evening, or even in the middle of the day or night. It just kind of randomly acts up. I would say excessively, like when I'm doing work, like after the dishes will start to act up. If I, you know, lift one of my children up, it'll start to act up. So any sort of exertion is kind of where I've noticed a lot of the pain coming from and tell me when did it start for you? I would send every about maybe a week and a half to two weeks ago. And you describe the pain is throbbing. Is there anything else about the pain in terms of the quality of the pain that you want to describe for me? No Just really throbbing okay, started about a week to two weeks ago. Okay. And do you recall what you were doing at the time that it started? I've been helping my husband clean out the garage lately, and we were lifting some boxes. And that's kind of I didn't notice it at the moment, but later in the evening, started to act up.  Okay. Umm I would like to hear about a little bit about the severity of it on a pain scale of one to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever had one or zero being no pain at this, How bad is this pain? I would measure it probably six or seven. It's become more of a nuisance than an actual physical pain. Okay. And is it a six or seven all the time? Um, whenever it starts to act up, yes.  Okay. And how often a day does that happen? I would say maybe two to three times per day. Do you notice any pattern to that at all? No. Okay. All righty. And can you point exactly to Where it is for me the location exactly? Kind of the area that just kind of wraps around the actual elbow than it is really bothering me. And does that pain go up your arm or down your arm or anywhere else on your arm? No It stays right in that area. Is there anything else that goes on at the same time? Any other symptoms that happen anything else other than when the pain is happening there anything else going on for you? Not that I've noticed, No. Is there anything that makes it feel better? Um, nothing that completely gets rid of it. I will relieve it for a temporary period of time. But it hasn't gotten rid of it. And how much time it will do take? I whatever it says on the bottle usually wanted to tablet is that regular strength or extra strength? regular strength. You just take it across the counter to normal directions on the bottom. correct Okay. And does anything make it worse? Um, like you mentioned any sort of exertion, picking up a child doing the dishes, pretty much daily kind of living.  So using it. Yes. Have you seen anybody else for this complaint? Um, no.  Have you What else have you tried other than the Tylenol and anything else? Um, I've attempted to use a heating pad on it. And I've also attempted ice. Neither were successful.  Okay. It sounds you've talked a little bit about how it's impacted, you know, you to be able to work in the garage or do the dishes or lift your child is there Other impact on your life, Umm like I mentioned is more of a nuisance. There'll be times in the middle of the night that will start to act up. If I get up to go to the bathroom. I'll notice pain in my elbow. Does it wake you up at night? It doesn't, but if I wake up in the middle of the night Well, trouble me and falling back asleep.  Okay.  What do you think it is? Um, I'm not quite sure my best guess is maybe some sort of pulled muscle or something. But I honestly don't know. All right. What I'd like to do now is just kind of go through all the things that you told me and summarize for you. This is information that I want to take that but I want to make sure that I have it all correct. So if I've forgotten something, or I've gotten something incorrect, please, please help me.  Okay. You came to the clinic today for a complaint of left elbow pain, and it's pain that you mostly noticed when you were bending it or using it in some capacity. It's a throbbing pain that happens randomly, but it does happen two to three times during the day, which you notice about is if you exert or you extend or flex your elbow at all, that's when it seems to be at its worst. It's gone on for about a week, maybe two, two weeks when you think back on it, and it started out when you were helping your husband clean the garage and you were lifting locks of boxes. So about a six to seven on a pain scale. And you describe it over and over as being a nuisance, which tells me that it's getting kind of in the way of doing some things that you want to you report that it happens probably two to three times a day, and that the pain wraps around the joint. Completely, you've taken some Tylenol for it across the counter, you've taken that several times a day now with without much relief right that it hasn't helped much. You've also tried a heating pad, you've tried some ice, that hasn't really helped either too much. It sounds like you know, again, you kept referring to it as an as a nuisance. It's just kind of getting in the way of your daily activities. It Doesn't necessarily keep you up at night. But you do notice it at night when you wake up that it's still going on for you. So sleep doesn't seem to help much. And that what you mostly think this could be is a pulled muscle of some type. Is there anything I forgotten or that you wanted to tell me about this? I'm not that I can think of no. Thank you for telling me about your chief concerns. So I'm going to take it back to Dr. Smith. Thank you very much.",
