As I mentioned, I want to move to a new section Now this one's about your social relationships. Are you okay with answering some questions about your social relationships? Yes, why not?  Okay. Tell me about your friends. Okay. you start with high school, okay. Well, what behavior do you think? Did that? I guess my gambling and my promiscuity? Um, you know, like, for instance, well, I mean, this one friend from high school was were really close. And I ended up getting with her boyfriend when they were together. But I mean, people forgive each other, like, what's the big deal, and she couldn't get over it. And then the other my other friend got mad at me for that because they slept with their boyfriend, but I was drunk. And, I mean, I was gambling that night. So really, who cares, but I don't know. And then I would post on Facebook and just constantly post Just about different guys or that it was gambling and that it was winning. You know, I didn't I think it turned some people off, I guess but I don't know why it was it was just having a good time. And was this all back in high school? No, this was like, just this couple PAST COUPLE Oh, recently Oh, yeah. I because they were my friends in high school have through the years they kind of just killed off so. So so you have a good number of friends in high school because of certain occurrences. You don't have as many now? Yeah. About how many close friends would you say you had? back in high school? There was like eight of us and a group of girlfriends And how about now? I don't have any of those friends. How many close friends do you have? I don't I don't I don't really have any close friends. I mean, just acquaintances. Really? I kind of just like doing it that way better. Sure. Yeah. How many acquaintances? Men or women, like just friends? Or how many would for friends? I haven't met. For men. There's, there's there's a lot like 10 that I see fairly regularly. Yeah. Can you describe to me your relationship with these? These 12 acquaintance? Um, well, the women at work like I usually just tell them about like my fun, you know, times that I'm like gambling and meeting men and you know them buying me things and me buying them thinks I'm winning all this money. And then I usually go back to work and tell them that You know, I don't have any money left because I used it all, you know, first, because I'm gambling second because I want to show off for the guys and just the thrill of it. So that's just usually what I talk to them about. And the men usually are just that I encounter a while gambling or shopping or when I'm drinking, and I could just meet them just at you know, the the blackjack table or whatever. I could just leave them there. Or just online. So you mentioned social media before, can you tell me about your interaction on social media? I'm actually enjoy social media a lot. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's, it's great. It's a great outlet, especially when you have a lot of ideas and you just want to get it out there. And I think that it's really great for me to express my ideas and stuff like that. I'm just going through and so I use it. A lot. Hold on. I do. Yeah. And especially when I'm out like, I mean, I don't know if you're familiar with like, like Facebook and tweeting or Twitter. Like on Facebook, I mean, I, I'll post, like every, I would say every 10 minutes when I'm out. I just will post about, like, my night, or just a cool idea I had about just starting a business or anything like that. Yeah, and I'll post a lot. And like Twitter, it's pretty much like every two minutes because it's super fast. So I'll do that, like every two minutes when I'm out. So a lot of people follow or read the posts? Oh, they do. A lot of people doing some people think oh, that's a great idea. And then like, you know, an hour later, they're just like, hurry. Like, is everything okay? Like, are you fine? You know, I quickly unfriend them. Because they're not like following what I'm saying. And then I have people that unfriend me because they don't like them post thing all the time, but really that's what it's there for. And it's there for me to express myself. And if they can't handle it, then well how about I want to ask you about interests like sports, music, the arts, television, you have any you mentioned social media seems like an interest and the other interests like hobbies like interests. I like shopping. I love shopping. Going away. I like vacationing in nice places. I'm how about talents? Do you have particular talents? talents? shootout for meeting people and having like, charismatic Yeah, okay. Yeah. Any other talents? Like Tell me about? Not really. So, anything regarding social relationships, like your friends interest, talents, social media, anything you want to tell me on this before we move to the section now that, that I just like to have a good time, and I just want people to understand that. Yeah. So that's it really you feel like people, like people you mentioned that would see you on social media or your acquaintances, do you feel like they understand you? you know, because they've all friended me, so I guess they don't understand me. They just don't get it. You know, which sucks but all of them or there's some that? there's some like that I'm still friends with but the you know, I mean, the just people that I went to high school with our college they have all in front of me, but as far as like this acquaintances You know, do you have any friends that I do. I want to thank you for helping me complete this section of the intake. And if you're okay, we'll move on to the next section.\",\n          \"Summarize: Carl How you doing today? Good,  good how are you? I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. Last week you were talking in therapy? Yeah. I mean, I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week, but but Jill was telling you about Jill, a co worker. And, you know, she was kind of bothered me the past couple weeks, but really, this this past week was like the worst, right? So she's not doing her paperwork. And the thing is, is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports. So if she doesn't have hers, I can't do mine. And then I can't get mine out in time for the next person to do theirs and it's a mess. The whole thing's a mess. And it's just it's annoying. So her work slow down, or not being efficient work is affecting your work productivity. Yeah. Yeah, it definitely is. And it it's one of those things that like, you know, has, it gives me a bad a bad evaluation, you know, like, if I'm not in my stuff in in time, the number reflects negatively on me, you know, and it's it's all kind of she's she's the first level, you know, and then all the other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time. So she doesn't, then I don't then the next person and so forth, and it makes it seem like you're not doing her job, right? Yeah. And my boss doesn't like it. my boss's boss doesn't like and so forth. You know, and I try to explain them. You know, she's the problem, but it doesn't always I don't always have the time to go up and tell them like, here's what's happening or just somehow it doesn't Now, you don't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about the situation. Yeah. And that's pretty annoying too. Because, you know, it's one thing if people get mad at me, but then I'm able to tell them why I'm not doing my job, like I'm supposed to. But it's another thing for them to get mad at me. Not realizing it's not my fault. You know, you have an explanation for why that works. Yeah, I do. I do. That's the thing. But I can't always get it out. You know, I can always tell the person that's has the complaint about and yeah, I mean, I've tried talking to my, my boss. And I've tried talking other people too, you know, but really hasn't gotten anywhere. So you're feeling stuck with this whole thing? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I talked to Joe a little bit about it, too. You know, and I tried to ask, I tried to kind of gently reminding her, you know, like, such and such needs to be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o'clock. I didn't want to be real abrasive, you know, but I, I tried to remind him as a polite approach. Yeah. Yeah. And it didn't didn't really seem to work because it's still happening. You know, your attempt to fix the problem hasn't really worked the way you want. It really hasn't. And, and that's just, I feel like I've tried everything that I could try. You know, and even like, I came home and I was talking to a friend about it, and I was trying to think of other solutions, right. You know, I was trying to think like, what else I could do what else I could say. Who else I could talk to things like that. You know, and my friend, you know, you He was listening and stuff. He had some good suggestions, but he didn't know what to do either like cuz he doesn't know the way the company works. So like, I got nothing. You're not getting the help you need for this. Yeah, not at all feeling pretty lost with it. And I wish there was just like a clear way to do things like this is what you should do now. And I don't see anything some sort of clear plan. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, I don't I don't see a way to go about it. I mean I've so I've Okay, so this is the way I laid out in my mind. I tried talking to the people above me didn't work out the way I thought it would. I tried talking to the people below me so to speak, just lower on the before me in the process. That's what I mean. And that didn't work out which is just Jill and I talked to her and that didn't work. So like, there's nowhere else I could turn. The options are exhausted. Yeah, that's what it seems like to me. And this is frustrating for you. Yeah, it is. And I've been trying to wrack my brain. You know, like, what else could I do? You know, like, maybe if I could maybe if there was like, a committee or something that I could go to, you know, and be like, well, this person's not doing what they're supposed to be doing. But there's not a committee like that. Or even if there was like a person, you know, like, a resolution person or whatever, but there's nobody like that. There's no other avenue.  It sort of seems like to me Yeah. I mean, that's and you know, as I'm even trying to think like, I don't know, should I Write a letter to somebody maybe. But I don't even know who or what you thought about a letter. But who would you send it to? Yeah. Or like just something else that I can I can do instead of going to this person though to that person that didn't work. Can I can I call somebody is there anybody else in the company that you know might handle stuff like that? But I mean, there's there's HR people, but I can't really see where they could come in. I don't know how human resources could deal with something like that. You don't view them as a potential solution. No, I don't. Wondering if there's like a But there's I mean, I'm thinking now that there's gotta be something or somebody, or somewhere that I could put in, like, almost like a complaint or something like, something's out of my hands. And I don't know what to do about it, but there's got to be something. And now that I'm saying this, I'm thinking that there's got to be some other resource you haven't tried yet. Yeah, yeah. I mean, now I'm trying to think back to my training, you know, initially you know, maybe there's, you know what, I think now that I'm, now that I'm thinking a little bit harder about a little bit differently about it. I'm thinking that there's like, man, I forget what they call it now, but maybe like a complaint but It's not the right word, but maybe a complaint box or like suggestions or something. And I think, if I remember correctly, those suggestions and those complaints get brought up at every staff meeting, which we have, like every other week. They're discussed at this regular meeting. Yeah. And I'm thinking now, I mean, nobody really uses it. But I'm thinking like, maybe that's an avenue that I can use, you know, like, maybe that'll get brought up. And maybe that's something that that might actually work.  This could be another option for you. Yeah, it could be. And then if it does work, it'll get brought rather if they do read it, it'll get brought up at the staff meeting. where everybody's at my boss, my boss's boss, Jill, everybody's there. And maybe that's a way for it to come to most attention. That deadlines being missed, affect other people in ways that you don't really know about. So everyone will hear your complaint and maybe react in a way to help you maybe. Yeah, I think that's, I mean, that's gotta be the way to do it. And maybe that's the best way. I really think. Yeah, I mean, after saying all that, and after going through that, I really think that that's probably the best way to do it. And if it doesn't, then I guess I can find another way. But I really think that's the best way to do it. You feel as though you found an option here? Yeah. Yeah. And even if that doesn't work, then it'll be brought up. And maybe it'll allow me to talk to my boss further about it. And maybe I'll understand really where I'm coming from. But this will at least be a start to something you know, to make me a lot less stressed with deadlines and stuff in your first Started with all this. Yeah. But maybe, maybe after I do that, you know, put in the complaint or suggestion. Maybe I won't be as frustrated. I mean, I'm feeling a little less frustrated now. Even thinking if there is another option. It feels better now as you're contemplating and another potential Avenue here. Yeah. Yeah, that's, well, this might be a good place to wrap this session up. That feels like the right. Move for you. Yeah. And we'll schedule See you next week. And we can pick up from there. Sounds good. All right. Cool. Next car. Thank you.\",\n          \"Summarize: Are you doing today? Okay, how are you?  I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. Yes, um, I would like to be able to kind of I've been feeling a little depressed and I would really like to be able to reduce those depressed you know, the depression. So reduce feelings of depression. Yes, that'd be a cool okay. Yes. So Sounds like a good goal. So what objectives what tasks Do you think that you could do? That would help you to feel less depressed? I guess maybe some sort of physical activity, maybe like walking. I like to be outside. So maybe walking could be one. Okay. Have you had a plan before we have walked regularly? You know, I used to. I did. And it was, it was, it was a it would give me some relief, because I was I was able to clear my mind whenever I was walking. And so I Yes, yes, I've had success with walking before. So Walking has worked before. Yes. And you notice that you're walking less since you've had a first impression. I really haven't been doing too much of anything I've just been kind of at home doing homework, stressing out over doing getting homework done. Because I'm, you know, back in school, and it's been so stressful and overwhelming. You know, like I said, it's just kind of gotten me in this little funk, this depressed mood. So since you're on the topic of homework, which is something you think you can do there, you mentioned that it's stressful and overwhelming. And that sounds like the type of feelings that are related to depression sometimes. Mm hmm. Do you find that kind of being stressed about homework is? Yeah, because you know, is there's so much work to be done and sometimes a good you know, several assignments. Do And at the same time, and I find myself rushing to get assignments and and, you know, it can just be a little daunting. It's just overwhelming sometimes. So yeah. And I don't know, maybe if I spaced that out and, you know, took, you know, did some time management or something like that I don't know, to kind of help me feel like maybe you're starting the homework late compared to when it's due. Yeah, yeah. That's the feeling maybe of overwhelmed. Yes, I would say that. So, yeah, you're right. It sounds like this is just an organizational thing, right. So if you if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier, and do it in small bits, okay. Instead of me waiting more or less the last minute, right. That would reduce the mean likely, I would think reduce some of the stressed feelings of being overwhelmed. I'm sure it would you sure would. So one, make that your sec objective then so you have the walking, okay. And then you'll have trying to space out the homework.  Okay, that sounds doable sound good. All right. Yes. What other objectives might work? Let's see. that worked in the past for you. You know, it was something that I enjoyed doing. And right now I feel like I'm not doing any of the things that I've enjoyed doing because I've been so busy doing work doing homework, so I think that would probably help. So it's a good break from thinking about stressing about this you put it to homework Yes. It has kind of come in the singing parts fun for it sounds like but also there's a social component seems like Yes, it is. It is. Enjoy access to enjoy singing, and, you know, I enjoy the people that I was saying with and we will go and hang out together, go to different, you know, like jazz clubs or events, you know, different bands that were playing it you know, it'll just be nice. It's fun. I love music. So I love listening to it and I love you know, singing. So making music. So that was great. I think that would be a good goal. You seem to kind of light up a little when you talk about singing. Yes, it's I I just love it. I enjoy doing it. And I just haven't had a chance to deal with lightning. so far. This is justmaking the time. Yes, yeah. Yes. Good. All right. So we'll make that the third objective. So we have walking and kind of organizing your homework differently. And then singing and that, that socializing, it's the companies that, that singing that's great. So three objectives is good. I try to get to four. If you have one. Is there a fourth objective that you can think of something else that you've associated with not feeling depressed when I used to absolutely love going to the beach and visiting with my aunt. And so that's two things. The beach. I love the beach because it's soothing. It's company. And I, my, she's just such an awesome person and she's always pouring into me and I just love spending time with her. So she lives down to pitch. Yes, she does. Okay, so this seems like a good, good objective to Yes. So you're suggesting maybe visiting her more often? Yes. Again, just at home doing homework, and I haven't gone to visit her in a while. And the thing is, she only lives like an hour away. So it's not a it's not right. No, it's not. So that's like a, you know, a trip I couldn't do on a Saturday. Take a break and go down there and spend some time with that will be I think that will be helpful. So again, kind of kind of getting away from the school stressors. Just take taking a break from it for a day. Yes. And then also spend time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with. Good. Good. All right. So I want to go through each one of these. And just make sure that we're kind of meeting all the criteria for an objective, which I think we can do, but these are all specific, which is good. Do you feel these are all achievable? These are things you can do. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Well, someone that knew done in the past, right,  right. So now we have the specific and the achievable. I don't want to get too personal and more tricky, which is making it measurable. I like to do here. I don't want to be overly prescriptive in terms of objectives. I want you to decide. But I want to see We can quantify, in some manner, how often you'll be able to do these different things or how, you know, quite like a homer but to think about the spacing would be the quantity but, but first with the walking. So in a given week, say what's realistic for you in terms of getting out and walking? How many times? Um, maybe I can start out with twice a week, twice quickly. Okay. Do you have two particular days in line days for your responsibilities aren't too great. You have that opportunity? Maybe we need to start with one day a week. Okay. Let's go one day, one time, one time a week. Let's talk with one and then we'll see what happens. Okay,  so what day of the week are you thinking? About Monday? Consider a window of opportunity you see on Monday. It is. Yeah. Plus, it just kind of, I think, no, no. How about Wednesday?  Wednesday? Yes. Wednesday, middle of the week. Stress from work and school and yes, Wednesday. Sounds good. Once you have a particular time range, you like to walk a few times a day, like 6:30. That's a good time for you. As the time you can get out of house, yes, off work. And give me a little bit of time to get home and change and out the door. Because if I, if I make it too late, I'm not going to go 6:30 is kind of a good, that's a good time. Yeah. 630 good. So we'll start with that objective. The Walking Every Wednesday at 630 for every amount of time are comfortable with. So, the homework is a little trickier, right? This is about spacing it out. Okay? So the homework assignments, they're stressing you out. How much time did they take? Last few few questions. How much time do they take to complete? Generally? Like an hour? So it depends on the assignment. If you had the average of the average two hours let's go to worst case, let's go two and a half hours just to cover code worst case will generally be the worst case. Maybe it depends, because when we get three,  yeah, the second two to three hours, okay. And then how much time do you have when it's assigned to when it's due usually Maybe a couple of weeks. A couple weeks. Yeah. I get distracted. So a little distracted. So it's, you know, I start reading and I'll fall asleep or I get distracted by something. And then before you know it, the time is gone. And I'm rushing at the end to get it shown up to try and get it all done. So I was ready to do the work to ease into the last Okay, yeah, I could see how that would be stressful. what day of the week isn't usually a Sunday. On Tuesdays on Tuesdays. So you have Tuesday, and then you have another Tuesday and the week after that, you have three hours of work. And those two weeks. shipping. Okay? Yeah, will be the first day and time but kind of like when you specified Wednesday 630 that's gonna be a walking time, right right at the time, and you can start the homework because the first time I'm come back from my walk on Wednesdays. How long do you foresee Well, normally only half an hour. So to get some time to decompress and round Alright, so from eight to nine on Tuesday, or Wednesday, on Wednesday, you'll get the first third of the homework. And then and then just stop. Okay, that'd be that'd be done for the night. Okay. All right. That's some big plans. How about that second hour? I'll get started. Thursday, so it's just one day apart. Yeah, that's due Thursday. Oh, do come Thursday. Yeah. an hour. Yes. And what hour do you have in mind? Thursday's So but 7070 so one night, Wednesday be at nine o'clock. And then on Thursday, seven nine was two hours. Seven days. Sorry. Okay. So now just the last hour remains Sunday, Sunday through Sunday. Okay. So you you want to get everything done from Tuesday to Sunday night? Yeah, the rest of that time off. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Sure that's achievable. That seems like you're, you're getting a lot in there, but you think you can do it? I can try. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. All right. What time Sunday, Sunday around five to five to six, five to six. Yes. And I'm assuming it won't run over because we kind of have to be on the high side, but if it did, I would be able to go five to seven So that's kind of like, yeah, flexible time there. Yes. So what would that feel like to get your homework done? But it would be a relief. Okay. So, and there's a potential backup plan I see in here is that if something happens on Sunday, where you need more time, and you don't want to stress, you still have that Wednesday after you walk bacon. Yeah. So that could be like your, your backup. Yes, that makes sense. Yes. Because you still have another six days to have done after that. Right. All right. So all those seem realistic and achievable. It does. Every so many Fridays. every friday So, so this is this isn't every Friday commitment. Right, this thing? Yeah. But one Friday is generally it's maybe about two hours, two hours. So two hours every Friday. There's something really enjoyed though. So and it sounds like you look forward to it. Yeah. So Friday, two hours, I guess. Yes. afternoon or evening. Evening. Okay. Yeah, I mean, if I if it was something that came up that I really had to get done is not like I can't not go. So it won't be managed, right? Yeah. Good. Okay. So that was the last objective this is. This is I guess about a whole day commitment, right? Because you go to the beach, it's an hour drive, so you probably wouldn't want to go down for just a few hours. More like the whole day, would they? That would be more like a Saturday. But of course, it wouldn't be every Saturday. So how many times and say a month, like once? Once a month? Okay. So you go down on Saturday morning and come back? Yes. That's something to look forward to. Yes. Is that something that would be okay, in terms of like, because on Friday night, potentially, you'd be out. Right and then Saturday. Yeah, if I, if all those Saturdays that I know that I'm going I could not be out too late on that. Okay, that's a good idea. So you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out? Yes. When you know that Saturday is coming or not go at all, that's fine. Either way, just take a break that time. Yes. Restore. All right. So that's four separate objectives. And what I want to do since I've kind of made a lot of specific notations here, I want to take a moment just take a break, and print this up for you. Okay, we'll work on the rest of your goals next time but I want you to have this so you can get started on it right away. So before I print these up as a changes you want to make um, I would like to try that And if it doesn't work, can we tweak? Oh yeah, we can always make changes. Maybe certain things will work really well. It Certain things, we'll have to take off the list altogether, maybe substitute something else. Yeah, we can, we can make edits to it the whole time you're here. Okay, we can just make a document that changes as as needed. But if you think it's a good starting place, I'll go and print this up as it is, and give you a copy and we can resume with today's session. And then next time I see in a week, or call the rest of the treatment plan. Beside the plan, yes. Thanks, Allison.

These acquaintances are people from work with whom the patient talks about gambling and rest are people whom they have met while gambling, shopping or drinking. The patient has high level of engagement in social media like Facebook and twitter, where they post their every thoughts to express themselves. This has made people unfriend them, and sometimes the patient unfriends people if someone expresses concern over them. The patient likes to shop and vacation apart from social media.

The patient doesn't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at their work about the situation and that is annoying too since people get mad at the patient. The patient feels stuck. They have tried to talk to the co worker Joe, but it didn't seem to work. The patient feels they are not able to find a clear plan and have exhausted all options.

Yeah, I just then recently I've just been feeling down a lot. And I can't really like snap out of it. Like sometimes if it's happened before, I can just like, get myself back on track. But recently, I've just found it really difficult to do it.  So it sounds like you've been experiencing some low mood and you're kind of struggling to get going a bit. Yeah, yeah, definitely.  You've had low mood in the past, but it's kind of you've been able to pull yourself out of it before but more recently, you found that harder. Okay, so I understand that you you first went to your GP he referred you here about two months ago. And can I ask what what led you to go to the GP in the first place? and my long term boyfriend broke up with me and it was such a shock like I really wasn't expecting it. And it's got me really down and felt really lonely and and I didn't really want to see people and she wanted a baby in space and the mom told me I should probably go to the doctors and and he is her family to you. Okay, so it sounds like you had that breakup and you weren't expecting it. So kind of came out of the blue a bit and, and that you've been on your own quite a lot. So you're not been seeing people as much and it sounds like your mom, notice that there's been a bit of a change in you. Okay, and how things been then since then, since that happened and since you went to the GP? I just nothing's really changed, nothing's really improved. I feel down like absence and feel distant from things and like I said, I can't stop all over. Okay, and how did you feel about coming here today?  And I was kind of disappointed in myself, because I feel like maybe else my ages doing this, like, I should have been able to snap out of it. Like, it's just another thing that I've not really affects me make me stand out for the wrong reasons. Okay, so you feel like it's kind of odd or unusual to be here, coming to see a clinical psychologist, I suppose I just want to reassure you that it's absolutely normal to have feelings of depression and anxiety. It's really very common, and it certainly isn't auto strange at all. So it sounds like it was actually quite hard for you to come here today. So what I guess led you to do that because it sounds like maybe there was a lot pushing you against coming here today, but you've managed to come anyway.  And I'm just hoping that it's going to help. I think I didn't I didn't really want to admit it, because like it's just another failure. But my mom was talking to me and, and she's, she's not really happy with the way I'm behaving and I don't really want to disappoint her again. And so I thought there's no harm in  this So sounds like partly you're doing it then your mum because you're a bit worried that she she isn't pleased with you at the moment. Yeah. Okay. And I think it's great that you've come here. And definitely there's a lot of evidence to suggest that psychological therapy can help depression and particularly the type of therapy that we're going to be doing, which is called cognitive behavior therapy. And I'll tell you a bit more about that as we go on, but I'm just trying to find out a bit more about you today. So I saw from your notes that your medic student Yeah, and not currently in the Unii room and but yeah, last year as a medical student, okay, so I guess what, why, what's, what's the reason that you're not in uni this year? and I Like he is pretty tall fast as a then suggested I took a year out. This is the Break. Okay, so just thinking that would be about six months ago was it that your ear out started, and it sounds then maybe like your first year was also quite tough. Yeah, was that I thought we still for everyone, but obviously we'll take it in different ways daily. And you're planning on the panning on returning. And yeah I am gonna have to really so. Yeah don't sound too sure about that though? I think return is probably that's what's gonna make everyone happy. And I think you know, at least I'll be able to finally achieve something and get something right. So yeah, like next year, I'm going to get through it. Yeah.  Okay, so it doesn't, it doesn't sound like you want to go back. I do. And I do. Enjoy it, I just I just don't feel like mate the main man and I just, it's a lot of flack and a lot of pressure and but that's what comes with it and, you know, it'll work out for the best if I go. Okay, so I guess in there's quite a lot of thoughts and feelings about going back at the moment.  And I'm just wondering In the meantime, what are you what are you up to what have you been doing? And I've not really had much on the horizon men more men, have friends owns a restaurant. And like she suggested that did a better way to sit in there. Just deliver a bit like money and stuff because I've seen that in Uni. So, you know, I've done that. Okay, how many shifts have you done there? And I've only done one so far. And yeah, I don't know whether it's something that I'd probably go back to but  okay. How when was that shift? It was last week actually. Okay, and how was it, I suppose I'm intrigued. Can you tell me a bit more about that?  Umm it was, it was different, you know, because it was like I could. I did enjoy it because there's like, it's just different aspects and I had to like, speak to people and like, try to get their orders and try to remember it and stuff. Like, I wasn't very good. But I suppose like it was handy to have some money and, like, get out of the house. So it sounds like you quite enjoyed that then? Yeah. And what makes you think you weren't very good? I just I just bit slow and people sometimes they didn't stand by science, so I'd have to talk louder or quieter or slower and a bit confused sometimes with the orders. And then just don't really think that I'm not really like a friendly. Like, people don't really think that I'm a friendly person. They didn't really want to talk to me and stuff. I felt like I was like inconveniencing them by like, asking them things and getting things wrong. But yeah, they said they said that apparently and most people got like a few mistakes on the fascia. But then again, she's my mom's friend so probably why she's saying it. So the person who owns the restaurant is your mom's friend. Yeah. Okay, so it says you're saying that you think you weren't very good that's because you're a bit slow and you got confused with some orders.  Yeah. Is it? You said it's common for people to do that. Well, on that first shift, that's a she said toes, but and, but it's probably just, she's just trying to make me feel better she probably felt sorry for me because I'm obviously not very good at it. Like, I'm not very good for any things recently. I think she just felt sorry for me. Okay, so I've just been noting down some of those thoughts that you've been having. You kind of So you feel like you're not very good, you're slow. You're confused with the orders and you feel like you're inconveniencing her and she feels sorry for you. And I suppose I'm wondering I mean what makes you think that she feels sorry for you? Like, like such as my mother's friends and she's obviously feeling sorry for my mom as well because she's got a daughter it's not like anyone else who harried and she's just like all alone and she's not getting involved so I think she just feel sorry for me and she doesn't want to extend until upset me. Yeah. When you're having these kind of thoughts, because that's quite a lot of negative thoughts you're describing how do you feel? I feel empty. I do. I'm just calling as it is and just call it as reality. And I feel like I'm being honest with myself by just leasing it and not trying to get around tighten it because No, I can see myself so it sounds like you feel like these thoughts are very true then. I mean, if you're going to write them, so I'm going to pick out some of those thoughts you describe. You said, I'm not very good and I'm inconveniencing them. How much would you say you believe those on a scale out of 100? where 100 is like I absolutely believe it and zeros like I don't believe it at all. About 80 so you feel quite sure that you definitely believe okay. And you said that when you're thinking those thoughts, she started to feel quite empty. I just feel just, like sad. I'm not really myself. I just like it's like I'm not really bad, but when I am coming through Good job, and there any other emotions that you experience? feel drained. They feel like I'm in touch with anything And just like everything's going on around me, but I'm just not there. I'm just if I can just walk in Okay, so you feel empty distance you feel drained and how when you're feeling these emotions, how do you feel in your body? Kind of what sensations do you notice? I didn't know how to describe it. I got like I have a bit of like we can have any kind of got like butterflies in your nerves and stuff. Did you have butterflies that night when you're at the restaurant? Yeah, I was pretty nervous then. But when I got into it, they went away and like, it just talked to me for a bit. And so obviously, I realized that I wasn't doing a very good job. Okay, and when you When you have these emotions, how does it affect your energy levels? Do you feel more energetic, less energetic or about the same? i am feeling down Yeah. And when you're having those emotions that you were describing I feel drained like, then you will have like the energy to wake up in the morning sometimes, because y'll play less and less than the body's having and I don't want to. Yeah, sounds like you feel very tired. You're struggling to wake up. You said it's pointless. And then what do you do then when you feel like that? So I guess you just talked about when you wake up in the morning, and you feel heavy, and I suppose you've been maybe having some of these thoughts and those emotions, potentially the night before? What do you then do? How do you respond to that? I just have to go expose that don't really have a choice because my mom I live with my mom and I know it's hard for her. So I don't want her to be too worried. So I just I just tried to carry on as normal girl takes longer and I don't want to but I do. So now its my routine. So you're a bit slower and gets getting up. Yeah. But you are still getting up anyway. And what about your kind of what do you think about when you're doing that? I'm just thinking that nobody else is like mate my age like, maybe we should be feeling like this. And I'm the only one that does. So it sounds like you think a bit more about the problem and you kind of spend time thinking about hey, how can it hapen to me? I don't, I don't want to feel like this but i do and nobody else I know doors. So it makes me feel even more alone gets me even more down. I just don't display anyone and I should have anyone to it. Okay, so it sounds like you try and toughen up on yourself a little bit. Tell yourself to work harder to be different. Okay. And when you start telling yourself that kind of thing and how does that make you feel? Does that make you feel better afterwards or worse? feels worse because it still can't snap out of it. Like, I'm aware it's happening and I just, I'm trying but I just can't. And then and then it's just another thing that I'm feeling. Just another thing that I can't really get\",\n          \"Summarize: Tim, what's hard I mean, how does your body feel when you think about showing him that that vulnerable side of you? Can you feel that in your body? How does that feel? The sadness is like a stone in my belly. Is it? Yeah, sort of like and, and wanting to lift that stone out, so to speak, because the vulnerability, you don't want to be excited thankful for you to be so painful to be vulnerable. Right Whereas I think you have seen me in vulnerable situations more because of medical problems. And when someone else is vulnerable, not me. I can be seen as capable Ah, that's just so so so there's a sadness here, when your partner says, I don't really see, you don't really show me that softer part of you, there's a sadness there and it feels like a stone in your stomach, right? But somehow you helped me it's like, what I'm hearing is for you to actually touch that vulnerability and show him there's something about not being capable, they're not being strong. Is that it? Not really being knowing how to do that? How do you you, you show that vulnerability, how to actually name it or just stay with that vulnerability? And, and feel comfortable about doing that like, And to me, that's it, you know, you could say it's associated to trust or intellectually you can, but it's very, very difficult to actually It's difficult for all of us here to give that up. It's difficult for all of us. Right? Yeah. Right. And we all have that sense of needing to protect ourselves. Right? And I think what you guys are telling me, I mean, we go back and talk about your relationships, in your past relationships, we've often learned that it's very bad idea to be vulnerable. We're talking about that you guys are also in a cultural context where that's not encouraged to be vulnerable. Yeah. And to some degree, we have been vulnerable. you've been together for a long time, and so you're Is that what you mean? No, I mean, being gay. That's, yeah, yeah. Yes.  You're even more vulnerable, gay. There's a vulnerability about being gay. Period. Exactly. So there's an even you need to protect Yeah, I validate and normalize their need to protect themselves as individuals and gay men in a heterosexual world. \",\n          \"Summarize: Tell me about sure for any spiritual beliefs. Well, I was raised Catholic. So you consider yourself Catholic. But you feel like there's a lot of rules. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of do's and don'ts. Our church was very like, hell oriented. Like, if you do this, you're gonna go to hell to do this. We're gonna go to hell and like, well, let's let that's fun. How do you think those spiritual values influence your daily life? I mean, sometimes I do. Feel guilty about what I do. I feel guilty about, you know, spending more money than I'm willing to admit on drugs and parties, but I mean, I think you know, God forgive me. Hmm. How about racial ethnic identity? Well, I am Mexican. Mexican. Well, I'm very, very family oriented. Family oriented. Yeah, Can you tell me about your living housing situation? unsteady, or just really the word? Yeah. I mean, usually it's about there's a lot of us in one house. Like, right now I'm living with about six other people. And, you know, the fight happens or somebody can't pay the rent or I can't pay the rent. You know, I've moved probably about 12 times within the past year, the past year. Yeah. So, there's a part of it's not so bad. Yeah, but I could see it having an effect on my kids. How much for financial outlook  By financial outlook, well, I get assistance from the state. And I mean, I usually have enough to pay for everything. I mean, there's been some days that I've had to tell, you know, my roommate say, Can you lend me some money? Or my sister's always there if I need that from her? So occasionally you'll borrow money. Yeah. All right. How about your sleep? Do you feel like you sleep as much as you should? More than you should or less than you're sure much less than I should. Tell me about that. I mean, just to kids and getting them down and then taking trying to take some time for myself and sometimes I'm up late with, you know, being with people. smoking, drinking. I just don't that much. Or is that a problem that you want to work on? Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. I really like to get some more sleep. How about food intake eating? Do you feel like you eat more than you should less than you should or about right? More than I should more, I find myself like snacking a lot during the day. And I'll still have regular meal. So it's like meals on top of snacking on top of meals on top of snack and it's just a lot of food. Is that an area that you want to work on? Do you see that as a problem? Yeah, I guess I could work on that problem, but I guess now that you mentioned it. That'd be interesting. And maybe I want to switch gears again here. Trauma history. Now. You already told me about the What do you think may have happened or could have happened with your father? How about any physical abuse? I think you mentioned that earlier, right? Yes. Well, my dad would hit us while we're younger. And then after he went to jail, um, me and my mom would get into fights, sometimes. Physical fights, yeah. Had a few cousins that you know, would step over the line. Tell me what you mean by involved. You know, I punch back.  Well, what do you think happened in those situations? You feel like that? No, they were they were picking on me.  You were targeted? Yeah. Because I'm small. I'm sure. You know, my cousin's really towering over me so they would try to disrespect me Because they thought they could. And you would act out physically against them to defend yourself. So naives on occasion? Yeah. How about emotional abuse? My mom always tried to make me like I was the scapegoat a lot about that, even if it was her fault that the lights weren't on and there were no there was no water. It would somehow be my fault. No while you're, I had to bail your sister out again. So you know this happened and I had to drive around town to find your sister because you know, she was just off doing her own thing. So I spent all the money on gas couldn't pay them like that was always my fault. Everything was always my fault, even though I knew it wasn't but still harbor. That was painful for you. Yeah. Do you think that had an impact or that or the physical abuse had an impact on your life? What's happening now? physical abuse, I guess I try to end fights with violence, I guess, because I know how bad it can get. So I've tried to shut it down really fast, but probably not the most healthiest way. What's been the honest, that's why I think my sister and me are close. And so I blame my mom for that because she used me as the scapegoat. And then my sister was like, Oh, well, that's the bad sister. So you think your mother's behavior led to the way your sister treats you now? Yeah. Any other instances of physical or emotional abuse? No, not really.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 39,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Patient visits therapist for feeling and couldn't get back on track.
